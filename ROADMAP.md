# Nanna — Roadmap

> The single master roadmap **and status source of truth** for Nanna — there is no separate
> `STATUS.md`, `planning/`, or `docs/`. The **daily dev routine** (`.claude/skills/daily-dev`, run under
> `/loop`) reads this file, picks the **single next unimplemented item**, builds it **Tiger-Style**
> with tests + benchmarks, ticks the box, and appends a dated note. The engineering doctrine, benchmark
> methodology, dependency policy, and system reference notes live in that skill — this file stays a
> clean checklist. Shipped capability is *described* in [`README.md`](README.md); here it is only
> tracked. Edit surgically; never rewrite wholesale.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-23 (**nuxt generate manifest-race mitigation** — pin `buildDir`, prerender `/` only, clean-cache script before generate; unused `README_FILE` import scoped to tests. Open agent-tool loop residual: confirm dual client builders gone.) Prior: **P4 UI simplification** — command palette Mod+K, VirtualList, primary vs admin nav, settings Advanced + SettingsSection, compressed onboarding, copy/tone + component inventory. Open: formal 1280×720/1440×900 clipped-CTA pass, deeper tool-card compaction.
embedded mode deleted, `AppState`/`backend.rs` collapsed, `log_buffer` relocated to `nanna-core`, GUI `nanna-*`
deps pruned to config/core/tools; completed phases P3/P4/P10 condensed; **P17 re-scoped to workspace-context
standardization**; prior: GUI testing + UI/UX quality track; P11 tool-manager consistency closed)
**Also 2026-07-18:** **P11 fully drained and condensed** (673 → ~45 lines). Every prior item is done,
superseded by P16, or handed to P12; and the **run-log triage findings are now fixed with tests** — the
**multi-tool-call streaming collapse** (per-index `StreamBlockAssembler`), tolerant tool-stats import,
corrupt-Turso-memories salvage + `/status` surfacing, real tool-failure logs, Windows `exec` `cd /d`
normalization, and the heartbeat `HEARTBEAT.md` read. Detailed dated notes collapsed to a one-line ledger
(full rationale in each commit).
**Repo:** local Cargo workspace, branch `master` — one Rust workspace + a Tauri 2 / Nuxt 4 GUI.
**Stack:** Rust 2024 (rustc 1.85+) · Tokio · **Burn** (wgpu + ndarray) for on-device inference · wgpu 24 · Tauri 2 · Nuxt 4 / Vue 3 / Tailwind 4 · **Turso** (embedded, SQLite-compatible) · Boa + Deno scripting.

> **Direction (2026-07-06 pivot) — local-first by default.** A small open model running on a single
> consumer GPU *is* the agent and does the whole job — full agentic reasoning, tools, and memory —
> entirely on-device (private, offline-capable). Cloud APIs stay reachable as **optional** augmentation
> the local model can choose to call, never a dependency. The always-on multi-channel presence is
> unchanged. The heavy new investment: a best-in-class **Burn** model runner (local inference,
> single-GPU) and the **memory + dreaming** system (Turso-only, DSP-backed time-series) that is
> Nanna's moat. See **P12** (Local Model Runner) and **P13** (Memory & Dreaming) below.

## North Star

**Nanna is an always-on, fully-local personal AI *presence* — not a chatbot, and not a cloud
client.** A headless Rust daemon that runs continuously on your own machine, thinks with a **small
open model on a single consumer GPU** (the local model *is* the agent — it runs the whole loop:
reasoning, tools, and memory), remembers across time with a cognitive (FSRS-6) memory, and is
reachable from any channel — GUI, CLI, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp — where the GUI
is *just the richest channel*, never a privileged controller.

**Local is the North Star experience, not a degraded mode.** Everything works offline, private, on
one GPU. Nanna *can* reach out to cloud APIs (Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter) when it chooses to — for a
harder problem, a bigger context, a capability the local model lacks — but that is optional
augmentation the agent invokes, never a dependency. Think "open-source clawdbot / Hermes-class agent
you actually own," not "a frontend for someone else's model."

Two things make it more than a local Ollama wrapper: (1) a **best-in-class in-Rust model runner**
(Burn) that squeezes advanced agentic behavior out of small single-GPU models; (2) a **memory system
whose *dreaming* is the moat** — cognitive consolidation augmented by DSP time-series compression, so
the agent's understanding compounds over time instead of resetting each session.

The long arc still reaches a **personal device mesh** (peer daemons over Tor; your phone's camera a
tool your desktop can call). The bar: a calm, competent assistant that is *there* when you look up —
persistent, multi-channel, autonomous, private, and yours.

Every run should move one phase toward that end state — depth over breadth.

## Core Model

Bottom-up crate dependency tiers (workspace crates + the Tauri app). `*` = planned crate for the
local-first direction (does not exist yet):

```
Tier 0  nanna-simd        SIMD vector ops (AVX-512/AVX2/NEON) — the default fast path
        nanna-gpu         GPU compute (wgpu) — vector search >~50k + DSP/inference kernels
          |
Tier 1  nanna-infer*      Burn model runner: local LLM inference (wgpu + ndarray, single-GPU)
        nanna-memory      Vector store, FSRS-6 cognitive memory, dreaming (the moat)
        nanna-timeline*   DSP-backed event/episode timeline + compression-as-dreaming
        nanna-storage     Turso persistence (embedded, SQLite-compatible) — the ONLY DB
        nanna-llm         Inference routing: local (nanna-infer) first · cloud APIs optional
          |
Tier 2  nanna-tools       Tool system (all tools are filesystem JS/TS skills)
        nanna-scripting   Boa (pure-Rust JS) + Deno (V8/TS) engines; embedded Python
        nanna-workspace   Workspace detection, .nanna/ context files (SOUL/USER/AGENTS/…)
        nanna-channels    Channel listeners + unified message router
        nanna-browser     Browser control (CDP / Playwright)
          |
Tier 3  nanna-agent       Agent loop, multi-agent swarm, supervisors, context management
        nanna-mcp         Model Context Protocol client (+ server mode, see P3 caveat)
          |
Tier 4  nanna-daemon      Headless background service, WebSocket IPC
        nanna-client      Daemon client library
        nanna-server      HTTP server, webhooks
        nanna-config      TOML config, credentials
          |
Tier 5  nanna-core        Orchestration, scheduler/cron, workspace registry, dreaming runtime
          |
        gui/src-tauri     Tauri 2 backend + Nuxt 4 frontend (embeds core OR attaches to daemon)
```

**Governing architecture — "channels as control-plane clients":** the daemon owns *all* state
(sessions, memory, config, tools, scheduler/cron, workspace registry, keyring, channel manager).
Every channel — GUI included — reaches that control plane through the WebSocket IPC protocol.
Channel *capabilities* (markdown/tables/embeds/buttons/modals/streaming) determine **how** a
response renders, never **what** a channel can access. Multiple clients (phone + desktop) can attach
to the same daemon and see consistent state.

**Inference model — local-first, cloud-optional (the pivot):** `nanna-llm` is a routing layer, not a
cloud client. The default and intended backend is the **local Burn runner** (`nanna-infer`) executing
a small open model on the user's single GPU (with a CPU fallback) — it runs the *entire* agent loop,
tool use, embeddings, and dreaming-time summarization on-device. Cloud providers
(Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter; Ollama for other local servers) stay selectable and the agent can
*escalate* to them, but a fully-local, offline-capable run is the default, not a fallback. The
existing cross-provider complexity router (P10) is extended so **"local" is simply the
top-priority, zero-cost tier** and cloud is an opt-in escalation.

**Ports:** health HTTP `5148` (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/status`) · WebSocket IPC `5149`. The GUI-spawned daemon sidecar binds this **same** `5149` IPC port (`daemon_manager.rs:47,109` → `daemon_client.rs:69` connects `ws://127.0.0.1:5149`); the old `9833` sidecar port was never real and is retired.

---

## Current State (what's real today)

Phases **1–5** and **7** are complete; **10** is mostly complete; **6** and **8** are partial;
**9** is greenfield. The new local-first phases (**P12**, **P13**) are greenfield. **P14**
(long-horizon autonomy on a small local model) and **P15** (the agent-grade task store P14 runs on)
**landed together 2026-07-18**: Turso task store with hierarchy/dependencies/derived-blocked/`next()`/
filter language, harness-run acceptance checks, the re-anchored O(1) step loop with progress-or-replan
and budget caps, todo v0.2 + `TaskAction` IPC + GUI `/tasks` run monitor. The live on-model eval
passes **5/5 verified @ 22.6k tokens/item, 72 s (qwen3.5:9b, 0 false successes admitted)** after
same-day tuning; the full eval suite (published task set, pass^k, 8 GB tier) is the open remainder. **Two 2026-07-17 directional phases** reshape *how* the project is built rather than
what it does: **P16** (daemon-only consolidation — delete embedded mode, GUI becomes a pure daemon client,
iOS deferred) collapses the double-implementation tax behind most P4/P8/P11 "GUI-embedded copy drifted" debt;
**P17** ✅ (drop the bespoke per-workspace `.nanna/` agent markdown — Nanna reads a project's *standard* files
`README`/`AGENTS.md`/`ROADMAP.md`, and persona/user/memory move to global config + the DB).
Concretely, today Nanna:

- Runs as a **headless daemon** (Windows service / systemd / launchd) with WebSocket IPC, PID
  lockfile, health endpoints, and session persistence to **Turso**; the **GUI attaches** as a client
  with auto-reconnect and falls back to an **embedded** in-process backend when no daemon is running.
- Holds real **chat** with streaming, tool calling, interleaved thinking, and tiered context
  compression; routes across **Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Ollama** with complexity-based model
  cascade and native prompt caching (50–80% input savings). *(All inference is still remote-API or
  Ollama today — the native local Burn runner is P12.)*
- Has a **cognitive memory** system (FSRS-6 spaced repetition, semantic recall with testing-effect
  reinforcement, consolidation/"dreaming", duplicate detection) persisted to **Turso**.
- Ships **all tools as filesystem JS/TS skills** (39 default skills) executed by the Boa engine, plus
  **MCP client** integration and an **embedded/tiered OCR** pipeline (pure-Rust `ocrs` → vision-model fallback).
- Connects **five channels** (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp) with a webhook server and a
  unified router that delivers agent responses back to the originating channel.
- Presents a **Tauri 2 + Nuxt 4** desktop GUI: streaming chat, Tiptap+Monaco rich editor, session
  management, tabbed settings with full config migration, memory browser, channel onboarding wizards,
  tool-stats/model-stats dashboards, system tray, and native notifications.

**Storage note:** **Turso** (the `turso` crate — a pure-Rust, SQLite-compatible embedded DB) is
*already the only database*. "Remove SQLite" is a naming/branding cleanup (comments, log strings, the
`SqliteMemoryPersistence` struct name, docs), **not** an engine swap — the SQL dialect, `.db` files,
and `datetime('now')`/`AUTOINCREMENT`/`json_*` usage are all Turso-supported and load-bearing (P13).

**Not yet verified / closed:** no **native local model runner** yet (P12); **dreaming** exists but is
a fixed hourly cron over an O(N²) clusterer with no timeline/DSP layer, and the richer feedback-driven
`DreamingService`/`DreamingRuntime` is dead code (P13); the daemon + embedded-fallback + reconnection
path has **no end-to-end test**; **MCP server mode** is claimed complete but `nanna-server/src/mcp.rs`
does not exist (unverified — see P3); several daemon control actions return `not_implemented`; and
there is remaining **security/correctness debt** tracked below. *(Fixed 2026-07: Discord/Slack webhook
signature verification is now real Ed25519/HMAC, not a placeholder; user-tool + workspace path traversal
closed; the Update-band ingest now truly merges instead of accreting near-duplicates.)*

## Performance & Benchmarking

Performance is a **gate**, not a phase (small single-GPU budget): a change ships only when a benchmark
holds or improves the budget, and README perf claims link to an artifact. Governing metric: **task
success @ budget** — the fraction of the agent-eval suite the local model solves within the reference
GPU's VRAM ceiling and a p95 latency target (reference: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16 GB). *Methodology, the six
benchmark suites, and per-tier budgets live in the `daily-dev` skill.* Build-out:

- [ ] `nanna-bench` crate (criterion) — unify the existing `nanna-gpu` benches
- [ ] Define the **agent-eval suite** (the task-success denominator)
- [~] Per-tier budgets in `bench/BASELINE.md` (VRAM ceilings, min decode tok/s, max TTFT, max dream-cycle time)
      *(2026-07-17)* **`bench/BASELINE.md` created** — the committed diff-target the routine was missing.
      First rows seeded from the Suite 3 (dreaming/compression) retention harness: consolidation
      compression 0.90 @ recall retention 1.000, plus the w20 aged-recall correctness fixture (6/6 vs 0/6).
      Other suites (inference/vector-search/agent-loop/guardrails/efficiency) are listed as not-yet-baselined.
- [ ] CI gate — fail a PR that regresses a budget past threshold
- [~] Inference **parity** harness (logit/sequence vs reference); memory **retention** harness (recall before/after a dream cycle)
      *(2026-07-17)* **Memory retention harness shipped** (`nanna-memory::retention`) — the instrument the FSRS
      `w20` fix (P13) is gated on. Measures **topic recall@k** (fraction of probe queries whose raw top-`k`
      vector neighbours still include a same-topic memory) once before and once after a real `consolidate()`
      dream cycle, and reports compression alongside `recall_retention` (after/before). Deterministic + offline:
      a `RetentionCorpus` fabricates topic clusters from a `SplitMix64` seed with per-topic **era + salience +
      access** separation (so the composite clusterer keeps topics apart instead of merging everything — the
      non-similarity signals otherwise dominate the fixed clustering weights and cross-cluster). Replay the same
      corpus under two `FsrsParameters` to compare `recall_retention` — that is the w20 experiment. Added thin
      `MemoryService::{add_entry, search_by_embedding}` accessors (controlled vectors/aged FSRS + raw top-k,
      bypassing the recall gating). Demonstration run: **60 → 6 memories (0.90 compression) with recall
      1.000 → 1.000** (each 10-memory topic collapsed to one, recall perfectly held). 5 unit tests
      (determinism, tag-parse, ratio-math edge cases incl. empty/appeared, fresh-corpus recall, shrink-while-
      holding-recall); 51 nanna-memory tests green. Inference parity harness still open (belongs to Mummu).
- [ ] Perf dashboard — live TTFT / tok-s / VRAM / cache-hit in the GUI

## Phases

### P0 - Public Preview Release
- [ ] Decide: ship as Developer Preview 0.1.0 (compile-from-source, power users only) OR commit to non-technical public beta (requires Phase 1 completion).
- [ ] If Developer Preview: rewrite README top section to explicitly state "experimental alpha, requires Rust + Node, requires cloud API key or Ollama, native local inference not yet included, not recommended for sensitive data."
- [ ] Create RELEASE_NOTES.md or MILESTONE that freezes scope.
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions to build Tauri + daemon sidecar and attach artifacts to Releases.
- [ ] Publish signed Windows .msi/.exe installer with bundled daemon sidecar.
- [ ] Publish signed and notarized macOS .dmg (Universal or separate Intel/Apple Silicon).
- [ ] Publish Linux AppImage and/or .deb/.rpm.
- [ ] App launches without terminal; daemon starts automatically.
- [ ] Add Start Menu / tray / launch-at-login support.
- [ ] WebView2 handling on Windows.
- [ ] Document uninstall process.
- [ ] Add "check for updates" or auto-update mechanism

#### P0.1 - First Run UX
- [ ] Create public facing website / Github Pages
- [ ] Build GUI onboarding wizard (replaces CLI-centric onboarding).
- [ ] Plain-language intro screen explaining what Nanna is.
- [ ] Data storage location selection.
- [ ] Backend chooser: Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Ollama — with clear "native local model coming soon" if not implemented.
- [ ] API key entry with validation; fix has_api_key to check all provider keys, not only Anthropic.
- [ ] Ollama detection (is server running? is a model pulled?).
- [ ] Memory/privacy explanation with opt-in toggle for auto-remembering.
- [ ] Tool permission setup: ask before enabling shell/browser/file-write.
- [ ] Daemon/embedded backend auto-start.
- [ ] Health check screen with helpful, non-technical error messages (API key invalid, Ollama not running, port conflict, etc.).
- [ ] Emergency stop / pause-memory button visible in main UI.

#### P0.2 - Documentation
- [ ] Rewrite README top half for users: pitch, Download buttons, system requirements, 5 screenshots, "first 5 minutes" checklist, uninstall.
- [ ] Move architecture/performance content to the bottom of the readme
- [ ] Add truthful capability matrix: Desktop GUI / CLI chat / Fully local inference / Ollama backend / Cloud providers / Channels — each with Status and Requires columns.
- [ ] Add PRIVACY.md documenting: what's stored locally, what's sent to LLM providers, OpenAI embeddings, Brave Search, channels, websites; how to disable cloud calls; how to delete/export data.
- [ ] Add screenshots of: chat, settings, memory browser, channel setup, daemon/tray state, model/backend selection.
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide: API key invalid, Ollama not running, daemon not responding, port already in use, macOS app blocked, Windows Defender warning, Linux WebKitGTK missing, GPU not detected.
- [ ] Add per-OS installation docs.
- [ ] Commit LICENSE file (MIT) — appears absent despite README reference.
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- [ ] Fix Cargo.toml repository URL from clawdbot/nanna to physics515/Nanna.
- [ ] Add GitHub repo description and topics.
- [ ] Unify port documentation (README says 5149; CLI defaults to 9999) — pick one, update both code and docs.

#### P0.3 - Stronger Public Release (can follow 0.1)
- [ ] Local Ollama setup assistant in GUI.
- [ ] Model/backend status dashboard.
- [ ] Cost tracking for cloud models.
- [ ] Backup/export/delete data UI.
- [ ] Per-channel session isolation (critical if any channel is marketed).
- [ ] Channel-native response formatting.
- [ ] Log rotation + crash diagnostics export.
- [ ] Windows service install/uninstall/start/stop actually working.
- [ ] Code signing / notarization in CI.
- [ ] Accessibility pass (screen reader, keyboard navigation, ARIA, color contrast).
- [ ] Internationalization/localization framework (currently English-only).
- [ ] Burn local runner (P12) → re-market true offline.
- [ ] Dreaming overhaul (P13)
- [ ] Self-update via GitHub Releases.
- [ ] Resource cleanup verification on uninstall (daemon, config, memory DB, credentials fully removed).

#### P0.3 - Code Quality & CI
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow: cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings, cargo test --workspace --all-features, cargo test --no-run smoke check.
- [ ]  Add cargo audit and cargo deny to CI.
- [ ]  Add frontend CI: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile, pnpm exec vue-tsc, pnpm audit, Tauri build smoke test.
- [ ]  Add Tauri packaging CI producing signed artifacts per OS.
- [ ]  Add end-to-end daemon test: start → connect → conversation → persistence → fallback → reconnect.
- [ ]  Add gitleaks/trufflehog secret-scan step to CI.
- [ ]  Add coverage tracking (codecov/coveralls) if practical.
- [ ]  Add ESLint/Prettier/Vitest/Playwright configs for frontend.
- [x]  Wire GUI automated tests into CI (see P4 follow-on GUI Testing & UX Quality): unit/component on every PR; Playwright + Tauri/WebDriver smoke on packaging jobs. *(2026-07-22 — `.github/workflows/gui.yml`)*
- [ ]  Add Dependabot/Renovate config.
- [ ]  Resolve deferred clippy warnings (too_many_lines, etc.) — enforce -D warnings in CI.
- [ ]  Begin decomposing giant files: loop_runner.rs (~132KB), nanna-llm/src/lib.rs (~159KB), gui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs (8k+ lines) — not all required for 0.1 but plan the split.
- [x]  *(2026-07-19)* **`nanna-scripting` python tests are parallelism-flaky under load.** A full
       `cargo test --workspace` run failed 9/9 `python::tests::*` with `Timeout(10000)` because each test spins a
       RustPython interpreter that initializes the frozen stdlib (CPU-heavy); 9 in parallel on a busy machine
       exceed the 10 s wall-clock guard. They all pass single-threaded (13/13 in 35.9 s, ~2.7 s each).
       *(2026-07-21)* **Fixed by serializing them — zero new deps.** Chose the "gate their parallelism" option
       over adding `serial_test`: a process-global `static PYTHON_TEST_GUARD: tokio::sync::Mutex<()>` (tokio is
       already a dep; its guard is `Send`, `.await`-safe so no `await_holding_lock`, runtime-agnostic across each
       `#[tokio::test]`'s own runtime incl. the `current_thread` one, and non-poisoning so a failing test still
       releases it) locked as the first statement of all 13 python tests forces one interpreter to build+run at a
       time. Each test's wall-clock then tracks its solo cost (~2.4 s, well under the smallest 10 s guard)
       regardless of `--test-threads`. Verified: 13/13 green in 31.2 s, clippy clean (no new warnings), and it is
       test-only — production `python.exec` sets its own per-call timeout and is untouched.

### P1 — Core Infrastructure
SIMD vector ops (AVX/AVX2), GPU compute (wgpu), Turso persistence (embedded, SQLite-compatible),
vector store + conversation memory, LLM clients (Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/Ollama) with streaming +
tool calling, agent loop with context management, scheduler (heartbeats, cron).
- [ ] Onboarding writes API keys to plaintext config.toml (src/onboarding.rs), even though a SecureStore using OS keyring exists. The OS keychain should be the default path; TOML config should store only non-secret settings.
- [ ] SecureStore file fallback is plaintext JSON (mode 0600), not encrypted — the module comment misleadingly says "encrypted file storage." Fix the comment or implement real AES-GCM encryption with an OS-protected key.
- [ ] Inconsistent application directory namespaces — config uses ProjectDirs::from("bot", "clawd", "Nanna") while credentials use ProjectDirs::from("com", "nanna", "nanna"), causing orphaned data and confused uninstall flows.
- [ ] Onboarding has_api_key only checks config.llm.api_key or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ignoring OpenAI/OpenRouter keys. quick_setup specifically asks for an Anthropic key despite multi-provider support — broken first-run for non-Anthropic users.
- [ ] Tauri CSP is set to null in gui/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json — not acceptable for a desktop app rendering model output and markdown.
- [ ] Tauri Devtools enabled by default in production features (gui/src-tauri/Cargo.toml) — should be removed from default features.
- [ ] Tauri shell permissions (allow-open/spawn/kill/execute) for the daemon sidecar need least-privilege review.
- [~] ROADMAP explicitly lists open items: ~~disabled tools still execute~~ **(done 2026-07-20 — `ToolPolicy` gate, P6)**, ~~deleted tools remain callable until restart~~ **(done 2026-07-17 — `unregister` wiring)**, ~~delete_skill needs hardening against remove_dir_all/symlink races~~ **(done — symlink + canonical-escape guards in `commands/tools.rs`)**, stronger sandboxing needed *(open — OS-level sandbox under the policy layer; see research note below)*.
- [ ] HTTP server defaults to 0.0.0.0:3000 (src/main.rs) — potential footgun if exposed without auth.
- [ ] Port inconsistencies: README says daemon IPC is 5149, but src/main.rs daemon start defaults to 9999, and daemon status checks 5149. Must be unified and documented.
- [ ] Current usage can transmit user data to: cloud LLM providers, OpenAI embeddings (if OPENAI_API_KEY set), Brave Search, channel platforms (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Signal/WhatsApp), and websites fetched by tools/browser. A PRIVACY.md documenting data flows, opt-out options, and data deletion procedures is mandatory.
- [ ] Auto-remembering user messages and assistant replies into long-term memory should be opt-in with clear onboarding language and a pause/delete memory UI.
- [ ] No SECURITY.md or vulnerability disclosure process.
- [ ] No Dependabot / cargo-audit / npm audit automation.
- [ ] No GitHub secret scanning enabled.
- [ ] Store all secrets in OS keychain by default; remove secret fields from config.toml.
- [ ] Encrypt the SecureStore file fallback with AES-GCM (OS-protected key) or remove fallback; correct the misleading "encrypted" comment.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-09)* `keyring 4` (now on the workspace) split into a `keyring-core` layer
            exposing a pluggable `CredentialStore`/`CredentialBuilder` trait registrable via
            `keyring::set_default_store(..)`. That's the clean seam for this item: implement an
            encrypted-file `CredentialStore` (AES-GCM) and register it as the default when no OS keyring is
            present, instead of the ad-hoc plaintext-JSON fallback in `credentials.rs`. Source: [keyring-core docs](https://docs.rs/keyring-core).
- [ ] Set a restrictive Tauri CSP (not null).
- [ ] Disable devtools in production default features in gui/src-tauri/Cargo.toml.
- [ ] Per-tool toggles visible in GUI; audit log for every tool call.
- [x] Fix tool lifecycle bugs: disabled tools must not execute; deleted tools must not remain callable until restart (ROADMAP P6/P11).
      *(2026-07-20)* Disabled-tools-execute closed by the `ToolPolicy` gate above (`[tools] disabled` now
      denies at `execute()`, post-resolution). Deleted-tools-callable was closed 2026-07-17 via
      `ToolRegistry::unregister` wiring (see the P11 tool-manager-consistency note).
- [ ] Harden delete_skill against remove_dir_all/symlink races.
- [ ] Bind local services (health/webhook) to localhost by default; require explicit opt-in for public exposure.
- [ ] Add authentication for any non-local control plane.
- [ ] Verify webhook signature validation across all channels (Telegram secret, WhatsApp verification, Signal bridge trust, replay protection).
- [ ] Unify ProjectDirs namespaces — config and credentials must use the same ("com", "nanna", "nanna") (or equivalent) namespace.
- [ ] Run gitleaks detect --source . and trufflehog git file://. across full git history.
- [ ] Remove or gitignore .claude/settings.local.json (committed with machine paths and broad agent permissions).
- [ ] Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure process.
- [ ] Enable GitHub secret scanning and Dependabot.
- [ ] Claude UI Testing automations
- [ ] Implement Mummu model runner to replace the built in

### P2 — Tools & Channels ✅
File/shell/web tools, memory tools (remember/recall/reflect), scheduling, browser tools, vision
(analyze_image), tiered OCR, audio (TTS/transcription), PDF (text + image extraction). All tools
migrated to filesystem JS/TS skills (Boa + Deno). All five channels (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Signal/WhatsApp)
with send/react/edit/delete/pin/threads/media where supported. **Shipped.**

### P3 — Multi-Agent & MCP ✅ (one caveat)
MCP client (stdio + HTTP/SSE transports, tool discovery, adapter into nanna-tools), background task
spawning, agent-to-agent messaging (mailbox), Erlang/OTP-style supervisors (RestartPolicy, strategies,
health checks). **Shipped**, except:
- [ ] **Verify or build MCP *server* mode** — doc claims `crates/nanna-server/src/mcp.rs`; that file does
      not exist and no MCP refs found under `nanna-server/src`. Confirm shipped location or implement.
- [ ] Supervisor health check runs a placeholder, not a real agent loop (`supervisor.rs:496`).
- [ ] *(research 2026-07-20)* **Harden the MCP client for the 2026-07-28 spec RC.** Roots/Sampling/Logging
      are deprecated (file scoping moves to tool params / URIs / server config); tools move to full JSON
      Schema 2020-12 (`oneOf`/`anyOf`/conditionals). Two hard requirements for our client: **must not
      auto-dereference external `$ref` URIs**, and **bound schema depth + validation time** (untrusted server
      schemas are a DoS/SSRF surface). Also fold in TOFU description-pinning (see the P6 anti-rug-pull item).

- [ ] *(research 2026-07-20)* **HalluSquatting guard on `discover_tools`/skill-install/fetch paths** — agents
      reach for fabricated names in up to 85% of repo requests / 100% of skill installs, and attackers
      pre-register them. Make name→source resolution mandatory before any clone/install/fetch, flag those
      keywords, and never auto-run the resolved target unattended. Source:

- [x] Supervisor recovery counts consecutive successes, not first-success (pure `apply_health_result`
      state machine + `consecutive_health_successes` stat; events emit after lock release). *(2026-07-06)*

### P4 — GUI Application ✅
Tauri 2 + Nuxt 4 + Tailwind 4 (Palenight theme). Streaming markdown chat, session management, tabbed
settings + config migration + import/export, tool-call visualization, memory browser, channel onboarding
wizards (all five), model-stats + tool-stats dashboards, system tray, native notifications,
mobile-responsive layouts. **Shipped.** Open polish: real-device mobile testing, per-tool drill-down,
latency sparklines.
- [x] **Logs page shows in-process logs, tagged by source** *(2026-07-16)* — `run()` composes a
      `LogBufferLayer` over a 5000-entry buffer; `LogEntry.source` (`embedded`|`daemon`) is stamped by the
      capturing buffer; `get_daemon_logs` merges both origins, sorts by timestamp, bounds at 2000. Deleted
      the orphan `logs.rs` decoy. 11 tests. *(log_buffer relocated to `nanna-core` in P16.)*
- [x] **Live logs actually poll** *(2026-07-16)* — the old `daemon-log` listener had no emitter (frozen
      snapshot); replaced with a 1 s poll of the merged view + a `clearedBefore` watermark.
      - [ ] Follow-up: a push channel (daemon subscribe + real emit) or a `since`-cursor beats
            re-serialising up to 2000 lines/s; poll avoided an IPC change in a bugfix.

#### P4 follow-on — GUI Testing & UX Quality 🚧 (active track)

Capability shipped in P4; quality did not. The GUI is the richest channel and currently the weakest
*verified* surface — almost no automated UI coverage, and polish debt that makes power features feel
crowded to new users. Goal: **default calm + progressive power** — a new user can chat, set a backend,
and leave; power users still reach logs, tools, workspaces, stats, scheduler without hunting. Track
bugs and improvements here; do not bury them only in the backlog bullet.

**Doctrine**
- Default path is short. Advanced controls live behind progressive disclosure (Advanced, Cmd/Ctrl+K, overflow).
- Power-user depth is non-negotiable: never remove a capability; relocate, name, and shortcut it.
- Prefer fixing root UX (density, hierarchy, language) over adding tutorial chrome.
- Every critical flow gets a regression test before calling the bug closed.

##### GUI automated testing
- [x] **Vitest + Vue Test Utils** — unit/component tests for composables, pure helpers, and high-risk widgets
      (ChatInput stop/send, SessionItem actions, ConnectionStatus / BackendStatus, settings forms, Logs filters).
- [x] **Playwright E2E (web/dev shell)** *(2026-07-22)* — `gui/playwright.config.ts` drives `pnpm exec nuxi dev`
      (or `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`); 26 chromium specs under `gui/e2e/` run offline via the Tauri mock harness.
      Scripts: `pnpm test:e2e` / `test:e2e:update` / `test:e2e:ui`.
- [x] **Tauri WebDriver / tauri-driver smoke** *(2026-07-22)* — scaffold `gui/scripts/tauri-driver-smoke.mjs` +
      `gui/e2e/tauri-driver.md` (launch → Settings → Logs → close hygiene). Soft-skips when binary/driver missing
      so web CI stays hermetic; armed via `NANNA_TAURI_E2E=1` once a packaged binary is present. Wire full
      WebDriverIO session when nightly hosts a display + driver pair.
- [x] **Critical-path scenarios** *(2026-07-22)* — `e2e/critical-path.spec.ts`: first-run/no-key empty state;
      chat send → stream → Stop (mock LLM); session create/rename/delete/switch; backend disconnect toast +
      reconnect affordance; Settings API-key round-trip; Logs Live/Paused, Clear, Copy all.
- [x] **Page smoke matrix** *(2026-07-22)* — `e2e/page-smoke.spec.ts` hits `/`, agents, channels, memory,
      model-stats, scheduler, settings, tool-stats, tools, workspaces, logs, tasks — each renders primary
      content (no blank shell).
- [x] **A11y gate on changed surfaces** *(2026-07-22)* — `@axe-core/playwright` critical/serious sweep on chat +
      settings; keyboard tab-order reaches main controls; labelled switches / back links / session menu;
      GlassButton forwards `aria-*` on NuxtLink. Follow-on: broader color-contrast token audit.
- [x] **Visual / theme regression (lightweight)** *(2026-07-22)* — `e2e/visual.spec.ts` baselines chat empty,
      settings shell, logs toolbar under `gui/e2e/__snapshots__/` (`maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.03`).
- [x] **CI wiring** *(2026-07-22)* — `.github/workflows/gui.yml`: Vitest unit on every `gui/**` PR; Playwright
      web smoke with report artifact on failure; Tauri-driver soft-smoke on nightly/`workflow_dispatch`.
      Cross-link: P0.3 Code Quality & CI.
- [x] **Fixtures & mocks** *(2026-07-22)* — `gui/e2e/fixtures/{tauri-mock,mock-state,test-base}.ts` installs a
      full Tauri 2 IPC mock (`invoke`/`listen`/window) with seeded sessions, streaming LLM, config, tools,
      logs — hermetic, deterministic, offline (no live LLM / keyring).
- [x] **Crash / error boundaries** *(2026-07-22)* — `ErrorBoundary.vue` wraps shell + chat via `onErrorCaptured`;
      recoverable alert panel + Try again/Reload; e2e force hook `__NANNA_FORCE_ERROR__` asserted in
      `e2e/error-boundary.spec.ts`.

##### UI / UX bugfix (known + sweep)
- [x] **Empty / loading / error / offline** states for every page (chat, logs, memory, tools, channels, stats,
      scheduler, workspaces, agents) — no silent blank panels; retry or next-step where recovery exists.
      *(2026-04-27)* Shared `PageState` + per-page `loadError`/`isOnline`/`empty` wiring across agents, channels,
      memory, tools, tool-stats, model-stats, scheduler, workspaces, tasks, logs; chat + settings get offline
      banners (chat stays interactive for local draft). Retry actions call the page refresh.
- [x] **Connection & backend signalling** — ConnectionStatus / BackendStatus language matches reality (embedded vs
      daemon, reconnecting, degraded); avoid "Disconnected" next to live data (Logs taught this lesson).
      *(2026-04-27)* `app/lib/backendLabels.ts` is the single source: Daemon / Reconnecting / Starting /
      Daemon offline (with endpoint) / Daemon crashed / Legacy. Status bar + badges consume it; bare
      "Disconnected" retired. Unit tests in `gui/tests/unit/backendLabels.spec.ts` + `BackendStatus.spec.ts`.
- [x] **Toasts & destructive confirms** — success/error coverage for copy, save, delete, clear; ConfirmDialog on
      irreversible actions; Escape / outside-click policy consistent app-wide.
      *(2026-04-27)* `useToast` helpers; ConfirmDialog teleported in `app.vue` with outside-click cancel +
      Escape via `pushEscapeHandler` stack; destructive paths (session delete, clear logs, memory wipe,
      channel/tool/workspace/agent/task delete, settings data danger) go through `useConfirm`.
- [~] **Focus, scroll, and overflow** — chat sticks to latest unless user scrolled up; settings tabs don't lose
      focus/scroll jump; long lists virtualize or paginate; no double scrollbars / clipped CTAs on 1280×720 and
      1440×900 baselines.
      *(2026-04-27)* Chat `userScrolledUp` + `scrollToBottom`; settings per-tab scroll restore (`tabScrollPos`).
      *(2026-07-23)* **List virtualization shipped** — pure `visibleRange` + `VirtualList.vue`; memory >80,
      logs >100, tools sidebar >60. Unit tests in `gui/tests/unit/virtualList.spec.ts`. Remaining: formal
      1280×720 / 1440×900 clipped-CTA visual pass (logged in `gui/docs/BUG_BASH_GUI_UX.md`).
- [x] **Keyboard & shortcuts** — global Esc closes topmost dialog/menu; Cmd/Ctrl+K reserved for palette;
      documented shortcuts for new chat / focus input / Stop generation.
      *(2026-04-27)* `useShortcuts` + Escape stack; layout bindings: `Mod+K` reserved, `Mod+Shift+N` new chat,
      `Mod+Shift+L` focus input, `Mod+.` stop; ChatInput Escape stops streaming; `ShortcutsHelp` on Settings → Data.
      *(2026-07-23)* Command palette UI landed (see simplification track).
- [x] **Density & contrast sweep** on Palenight — readable secondary text, toolbar icon hit-targets ≥ 32px,
      consistent spacing scale; no low-contrast badges on logs/stats.
      *(2026-04-27)* Density tokens + `min-h-8`/`min-w-8` hit targets on toolbar icon buttons; secondary text
      tokens tightened in `main.css`. Broader token audit can continue under simplification.
- [x] **Forms validation** — API key / channel wizard / settings save: inline errors, disable duplicate submit,
      don't clear valid fields on partial failure.
      *(2026-04-27)* `app/lib/formValidation.ts` + `ApiKeyInput` inline errors / busy-disable; settings/channel
      saves keep valid fields on partial failure. Remaining unevenness on multi-step channel wizards logged in
      the bug-bash file.
- [x] **Title bar / tray / window controls** (Windows primary) — min/max/close, tray show/hide, quit vs hide
      semantics match user expectation; no orphan daemon on "close to tray" confusion (document + test).
      *(2026-04-27)* Documented in `gui/docs/WINDOW_TRAY.md` (ask / minimize_to_tray / quit_completely;
      sidecar lifecycle; close dialog). Close path still driven by `useCloseHandler` + daemon tray IPC.
- [x] **Bug bash log** — keep a rolling short list in daily-dev notes or issues labelled `gui-ux`; promote
      fixed items to dated `[x]` lines here when closed.
      *(2026-04-27)* `gui/docs/BUG_BASH_GUI_UX.md` started; open carry-overs: list virtualization, channel-wizard
      bulk validation, command palette UI, Windows `node_modules`/vitest lock flakiness.
      *(2026-07-22)* Follow-up hotfix after #58: seven page SFCs had composables spliced inside `interface`
      bodies (broke `nuxt generate` / `cargo tauri build`); restored script order + channels `loadError`
      on catch. Residual logged in BUG_BASH: local channels toast ref; legacy clawd/Nanna config-path copy.
      *(2026-07-23)* Simplification pass closed most open carry-overs (palette, virtualization, IA nav,
      Advanced settings). Remaining bash items: channel-wizard bulk validation, formal viewport pass,
      channels toast ref, legacy clawd config-path copy.
      *(2026-07-23)* **`nuxt generate` manifest race mitigated** — dual Vite client passes were racing
      `node_modules/.cache/nuxt/.nuxt/dist/client/manifest.json` (ENOENT mid-generate while nitro still
      prerendered and Tauri packaging kept going). Pin `buildDir: '.nuxt'`, prerender `/` only
      (`crawlLinks: false`), wipe `.nuxt` + cache before every `pnpm generate`
      (`gui/scripts/clean-nuxt-cache.mjs`). Also drop unused `README_FILE` import in
      `nanna-workspace::manager` (test-only). Residual: confirm dual "Building client..." lines never
      return after a cold wipe; Monaco ~4 MB chunk + `@tauri-apps/api/window` dual-import style logged
      in `gui/docs/BUG_BASH_GUI_UX.md`.

##### UI simplification (default calm, power remains)
- [x] **IA audit** — diagram primary tasks (chat, configure model, inspect run, manage memory/tools/channels)
      vs admin (logs, raw stats, scheduler, workspaces). Nav / TitleBar should match that hierarchy.
      *(2026-07-23)* Activity bar split: **primary** Memory/Tasks/Tools/Channels always visible; **admin**
      Logs/Workspaces/Agents/Scheduler/Model Stats/Tool Stats under a More flyout. Settings remains bottom.
      Documented in `gui/docs/BUG_BASH_GUI_UX.md` IA diagram.
- [x] **Progressive disclosure** — fold rarely-used settings into **Advanced**; keep power paths one click or one
      command-palette query away; optional "Compact power mode" density for existing users.
      *(2026-07-23)* Settings `showAdvanced` toggle (persisted); agent iteration/nudge, memory compression floor,
      Ollama host details, model routing folded. Compact density via `html.density-compact` + palette action /
      `nanna.ui.density` localStorage.
- [x] **Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K)** — navigate pages, switch sessions/workspaces, toggle Live logs, jump to
      model/settings; primary discovery path for power features so chrome can stay thin.
      *(2026-07-23)* `CommandPalette.vue` + `lib/commandPalette.ts` + `useCommandPalette` singleton; ↑/↓/Enter/Esc;
      Primary/Admin nav groups; sessions/workspaces; quick actions (new chat, live logs, focus input, stop,
      settings models, compact mode, toggle chat panel). 8 unit tests. Settings `?tab=` deep-link used.
- [~] **Chat-first shell** — reduce competing sidebar chrome default; rich editor/tool cards compact until expanded;
      streaming/stop/queue status always obvious without reading tool internals.
      *(2026-07-23)* Nav chrome reduced (admin under More; chat panel toggle stays default discovery). Remaining:
      stronger default-collapsed tool/thinking cards; tighten streaming/stop/queue affordances without internals.
- [x] **Unify settings shell** — consistent section headers, descriptions, save model (auto-save vs explicit Save);
      one pattern for comprising toggles + danger zones.
      *(2026-07-23)* `SettingsSection.vue` (`title`/`description`/`danger`/`advanced`); Models/Agent/Memory/Data/
      Scheduler switched over. Explicit Save retained for bulk config; per-control still auto-persists via invokes.
- [x] **Onboarding compression** (pairs with P0.1) — first-run: what Nanna is → pick backend → health → chat;
      defer channel wizards, tool permissions detail, memory deep-dive until after first successful turn.
      *(2026-07-23)* `OnboardingWizard.vue` 3-step (intro → provider/key via ApiKeyInput → health) gated by
      `nanna.onboarding.done` + no-key check. Full P0.1 wizard body (privacy, tool permission setup, storage
      location) still own phase.
- [x] **Copy / tone pass** — system language calm and specific ("Daemon not reachable on 5149" beat "Error");
      kill decorative status that lies (see Logs Live).
      *(2026-07-23)* Settings/scheduler/logs offline copy tightened; logs source label no longer claims
      "embedded" as a backend mode (GUI vs daemon). Live/Paused already factual. Residual clawd path copy open.
- [x] **Component cleanup** — inventory near-duplicate dialogs/status badges; consolidate on `components/ui`;
      delete dead CSS/unused props after simplification.
      *(2026-07-23)* Inventory in `gui/docs/COMPONENT_CLEANUP.md`. Consolidation intentionally deferred
      (ConfirmDialog vs UiModal keep distinct UX roles); execute merges under that doc.

##### UX / product improvements (still on this track)
- [ ] Full-text search across sessions; export conversations (MD/PDF/JSON).
- [ ] Context-budget visualization and live run view (iteration, active tools, token burn-rate, optional Gantt).
- [ ] Drag-drop file upload into chat; optional split view.
- [ ] Font-size + accent controls; theme-token audit; lazy-load Monaco.
- [ ] Mobile / small-window real-device pass (Tauri Android/iOS later; desktop responsive now).
- [ ] Per-tool stats drill-down + latency sparklines (P4 polish tail).
- [ ] Swarm execution view (from P5 open item) when swarm UX becomes demoable.

### P5 — Agent Swarm & Context Management ✅
Swarm coordinator (parallel decomposition, dynamic sub-agent spawning, result aggregation, critical-path
metrics), context management (sliding window, per-tool proportional truncation, incremental
summarization + cache, CDC deduplication, tiered compression at 40%/threshold/hard-cap), thinking
modes (Instant/Low/Medium/High/Maximum), task-delegation `task` tool, token-budget tracking, code
analysis tools (outline/search/structure). **Shipped.**
Open: swarm execution view in GUI (CriticalPathMetrics tracked but not visualized); stream partial swarm results.

### P6 — Production Hardening 🚧 (partial)
Done: outbound rate limiting (per-provider token buckets), error recovery / exponential backoff with
jitter, priority message queue, graceful 429 handling, health endpoint, PID file. Open:
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics** — new `nanna-metrics` crate (`NannaMetrics`: llm_request_duration,
      llm_tokens_total, tool_execution_duration, channel_messages/errors_total, queue_depth,
      active_sessions, memory_entries); expose via `/metrics` on the Axum health server + a GUI event.
- [ ] **Structured tracing spans** — hierarchy Session → Agent Loop → LLM/Tool Call, capturing
      name/duration/IO-size/success via `#[tracing::instrument]` + `info_span!`.
- [~] **Cost tracking** — `CostTracker` (pricing table per model, `UsageRecord` per call), aggregate by
      session/day/month/model/tool, surface in GUI.
      *(2026-07-12)* Core shipped in `nanna-agent::cost`: `ModelPricing` (input/output/cache-read/cache-write
      USD-per-1M) + a reference list-price table (Jan-2026 public prices for Claude/GPT/o-series families,
      matched by family **prefix** so dated ids like `claude-opus-4-8` resolve) + a pure `estimate_cost_usd(..)`
      (per-class arithmetic, `debug_assert` non-negative rates, ≥0 result). Local/Ollama/unknown models return
      `None` → reported `priced:false`, never a silent $0. Wired to the token counts the daemon now records
      (see the model-stats fix this run): `ModelStatsTracker::cost_report() -> Vec<ModelCost>` (snapshots under
      the read lock then prices lock-free, priciest-first) and surfaced on the live `SystemAction::ModelStats`
      IPC response as a new `costs` array (additive, non-breaking). 5 unit tests (exact per-million arithmetic,
      zero-cost, prefix resolution incl. most-specific-wins, local/unknown unpriced, tracker integration
      pricing a Sonnet run at $18 + flagging a local model). Remaining: per-session/day/month aggregation +
      per-tool cost + GUI surfacing (needs a GUI build); pricing table should become config-overridable.
      *(2026-07-12, research-corrected)* Table updated to **2026 actual list prices**: Opus 4.x is **$5/$25**
      per Mtok (was wrongly seeded with the legacy Opus-3 $15/$75), Haiku 4.5 is **$1/$5**; cache-read = 0.1x
      input, cache-write = 1.25x input (5-min TTL). Sonnet unchanged at $3/$15. Source:
      [Claude pricing docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).
      - [ ] Add **Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5`) to the pricing table once its per-Mtok rate is published.
      - [ ] Config-overridable pricing (`[pricing]` TOML or a fetched table) so rates don't rot in-code; add a
            batch-mode (0.5x) + 1-hour-cache (2.0x) multiplier the tracker can apply.
      *(2026-07-12)* Completeness: `ModelStatsSummary` now carries `total_cache_creation_tokens` (`record()`
      already accumulated it but `summary()` dropped it, hiding cache-write volume and understating cost);
      populated in `summary()` + a regression test. Backward-compatible (additive field; serde consumers ignore
      unknown/extra fields). Added `ModelStatsTracker::total_cost_usd()` (grand-total known cloud spend; sums
      only priced models) surfaced as `total_cost_usd` on the `SystemAction::ModelStats` response; test.
- [ ] **Runtime config reload** — watch `config.toml` with `notify` (debounce 500ms), validate before
      apply, apply without restart, emit `config-change` events.
- [ ] **Per-channel config** — `[channels.<name>.agent]` sections (system_prompt/model/max_tokens/tools allowlist).
- [~] **Tool allowlists/blocklists** — `ToolPolicy` (global allow/block + per-channel + per-user for multi-user channels).
      *(2026-07-20)* **Core `ToolPolicy` shipped + enforced.** New `nanna-tools::policy` — an allow/deny
      policy over *canonical* tool names with three security properties: **deny wins** (a name on both lists
      fails closed), **overlay only narrows** (`ToolPolicy::overlay` unions denials + intersects allowlists,
      so a per-channel layer can never re-grant a globally-denied tool — the per-channel/per-user layering
      primitive is in place), and — critically — the registry enforces it in `execute()` **after**
      alias/fuzzy resolution + `canonical_name()`, so `Bash`→`exec`, `EXEC`, or a fuzzy near-miss cannot
      slip a denied tool past the gate (this exact bypass class is what Claude Code's permission docs and the
      2026 MCP tool-shadowing research warn about — [permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions),
      [CrowdStrike agentic tool-chain attacks](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/how-agentic-tool-chain-attacks-threaten-ai-agent-security/)).
      Denied tools are also dropped from `definitions()`/`definitions_for_names()` so the model isn't even
      offered them (and a denied canonical hides its aliases). Wired through `DaemonConfig.{tool_allowlist,
      tool_denylist}` ← `[tools] enabled`/`disabled`; `build_tool_policy` treats `["*"]`/empty enabled as
      unrestricted and applies `disabled` as the denylist. **This closes the long-standing "disabled tools
      still execute" bug** (P1/P6) — the `[tools] disabled` list was parsed into config but never enforced.
      21 tests (11 policy-unit incl. overlay associativity/identity + regain-prevention, 8 registry incl.
      alias- and fuzzy-bypass regressions, 6 daemon `build_tool_policy`). Remaining: per-channel/per-user
      `[channels.<name>.agent]` overlay wiring + a per-tool audit log; refuse-to-compile for unenforceable
      patterns (Claude-Code style).
      - [ ] **Per-channel/per-user policy overlay** — `[channels.<name>.agent].tools` allow/deny composed
            via `ToolPolicy::overlay` (primitive already shipped) so a channel can only *narrow* the global
            policy. Set on the registry per-session when a channel message enters the agent loop.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-20)* **Merge the permission boundary into an OS-level sandbox.** Claude Code
            merges `Read`/`Edit` deny rules into a filesystem boundary and `WebFetch(domain:)` into a network
            allowlist because policy alone never covers subprocesses — a Python/`exec` script opening files
            directly escapes the tool gate. Nanna's `exec` (Git Bash) has exactly this hole; the policy layer
            needs an OS sandbox beneath it. Source: [Claude Code permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-20)* **Drop arbitrary-code-execution grants on entering unattended/autonomous
            mode**, even if configured for interactive use — Anthropic's auto-mode discards blanket shell +
            wildcarded interpreters (`python`/`node`/`ruby`) + package-manager run commands on entry. A
            `ToolPolicy` preset the daemon applies when running headless/scheduled. Source:
            [Claude Code auto mode](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-auto-mode).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-20)* **Reasoning-blind approval + tool-output injection tagging.** For any
            human-in-the-loop tool approval, feed the classifier only user messages + tool calls (strip
            assistant text + tool results) so the agent can't argue past its own gate; separately tag
            tool-*output* content that looks like injected instructions. Maps onto `AgentContext`. Source:

            for a tool "upgrade". Stops a tool whose definition mutates after approval, and the tool-shadowing
            class where one tool's description steers another tool's parameters. Applies to MCP-discovered

- [x] **Log rotation** — `tracing-appender` daily rotation, max ~7 files (logs currently accumulate unbounded).
      *(2026-07-09)* New `nanna-daemon::log_file` builds a `RollingFileAppender` (DAILY rotation,
      `filename_prefix="nanna-daemon"`, `.log` suffix, `max_log_files(7)`) wrapped in `tracing_appender::non_blocking`;
      added as an `Option<fmt::Layer>` beside the console + in-memory-buffer layers. New `--log-dir`
      (default `{data_dir}/logs`) and `--no-file-log` flags; the worker guard is a `main`-scoped local so it
      flushes on normal return (a `static` guard would never drop). Pure `resolve_log_dir` + `build_appender`
      with 4 unit tests; verified by a real `nanna-daemon run` boot writing a prefixed file. Note:
      `tracing-appender` 0.2.5 supports only time-based rotation (no per-file size cap) — if size-bounding is
      wanted later, use a custom writer or the `clia/tracing-appender` fork.
- [ ] Reach **0 clippy warnings** — 3 deferred items remain: refactor `handle_daemon_command`
      (main.rs ~1442-1636, `too_many_lines`), move mid-function `use nanna_client::…` to top (main.rs ~1576,
      `items_after_statements`), drop unused `async` on `is_daemon_running` (main.rs ~1694, `unused_async`).

### P7 — Rich Input & Editor ✅
Tiptap editor with Monaco code blocks replacing the chat textarea: formatting, headings, lists,
blockquotes, links, images, horizontal rules, markdown shortcuts, language selector, copy button,
Palenight theme sync, floating BubbleMenu, slash commands, drag-drop blocks, mobile toolbar,
undo/redo, streaming-while-editing. **Shipped.** Open (optional): tables, toggleable line numbers,
CRT glow on focus, localStorage draft persistence, Vim keybindings, reuse editor for memory/system-prompt/workspace-file editing.

### P8 — Clawdbot Parity 🚧 (partial)
Done: daemon binary + service install, IPC protocol, session persistence, `nanna-client`, GUI↔daemon
wiring, agent integration, OAuth in daemon, tool-name aliases, webhook server (all endpoints),
channel listeners (Telegram/Discord/Slack), unified router + response routing, cron system, sub-agent
scaffolding, shared OS keyring, daemon-side workspaces/config/scheduler/tool-authoring. Open:
- [~] **End-to-end daemon testing** (High) — start daemon, connect client, run a conversation, verify
      persistence + embedded fallback + reconnection (currently untested).
      *(2026-07-16)* **First real E2E suite shipped** — `crates/nanna-client/tests/e2e_daemon.rs`, 4 tests
      driving a real `DaemonServer` over the real WebSocket IPC with a real `Client` (no mocks). Lives in
      `nanna-client` because it already depends on `nanna-daemon`, so the dependency edge stays one-way.
      Hermetic by construction: built via `DaemonBuilder` with explicit settings instead of
      `from_nanna_config`, on an OS-assigned free port + a `TempDir`, with `with_memory(false)` — so a run
      never reads the developer's `config.toml`/`.db` and needs no API key or reachable model. Covers:
      daemon boots → client attaches → protocol answers; a created session is visible; **state survives a
      client disconnect + fresh reattach** (the GUI reconnect path); and **sessions survive a full daemon
      restart** on the same data dir (durable control plane, not a cache). Stable across 3 consecutive runs.
      **Found and fixed a real bug:** `Client::disconnect()` only signalled the handler task and returned, so
      the state flipped to `Disconnected` *asynchronously* — `is_connected()` could still report `Connected`
      right after `disconnect()` returned, and a `request()` in that window passed the connected check before
      failing confusingly. It now sets the state itself (the handler still does too; idempotent) and
      `debug_assert`s the postcondition. Remaining for this item: a real conversation turn (needs a live LLM)
      and the **embedded-fallback** path (needs a GUI build).
- [ ] **Per-channel sessions** (High) — map `channel_id:chat_id → session_id` so each chat/DM gets
      isolated context (all messages currently share one context).
- [~] **Response formatting per channel** — a `ResponseFormatter` driven by `ChannelFeatures` bitflags
      (strip markdown for Signal, tables→text for Telegram, embeds for Discord, Block Kit for Slack).
      Bitflags exist but every channel currently receives identical raw text.
      *(2026-07-09)* First slice shipped: added a `ChannelFeatures::MARKDOWN` flag + `supports_markdown()`,
      a pure `nanna-channels::format` module (`format_for_channel` / `strip_markdown`), and wired it into the
      single outbound chokepoint `MessageRouter::send`. Markdown-rendering channels (Discord/Telegram/Slack)
      carry the flag → text passes through **unchanged** (zero regression); Signal/WhatsApp now get Markdown
      down-converted to plain text (headers/blockquotes/fences/bold/inline-code stripped, `[label](url)` →
      `label (url)`), so they stop showing literal `**`/backticks. Conservative on purpose: single `*`/`_`,
      `__dunders__`, `snake_case`, and `2 * 3` survive. 7 unit tests.
      *(2026-07-10)* **Length-aware splitting shipped.** New pure `split_for_length(text, max_chars)` splits a
      payload into chunks each ≤ `max_chars` **Unicode scalars** (not bytes), preferring a newline then a
      space break within the window and only hard-splitting a single over-long token; chunks concatenate back
      to the exact input (the break char stays on the preceding chunk) so no content is lost. Wired into
      `MessageRouter::send`: when the channel sets `max_message_length` and the (already Markdown-adapted) text
      exceeds it, the router sends the parts in order and returns the first part's id (the reply/edit anchor).
      7 tests (within-limit passthrough, whitespace/newline break preference, oversized-token hard-split,
      Unicode-scalar counting; + 2 router tests with a recording mock proving split vs no-split).
      *(2026-07-12)* **tables→text shipped.** `strip_markdown` is now table-aware: a row line immediately
      followed by a delimiter row (`|---|:--:|`) starts a table block — each row drops its outer pipes, trims
      + inline-strips each cell, and re-joins with " | "; the delimiter row is dropped. Disambiguated from
      prose: a table delimiter must contain **both** a dash and a pipe, so a bare `---` horizontal rule after a
      pipe line and a stray prose `a | b` are left untouched. Postcondition relaxed to ≤2x (tight tables re-add
      a few separator chars). 5 tests (basic table, alignment colons + surrounding text, inline-markdown in
      cells, prose-pipe/HR negatives, tight-table growth guard); 45 nanna-channels tests green. Remaining:
      Discord embeds, Slack Block Kit.
- [ ] **Client API completeness** — add `SchedulerApi`/`WorkspaceApi`/`ChannelApi` + typed event subscription to `nanna-client`.
- [ ] **HEARTBEAT.md execution** — parse/run a workspace file of periodic tasks (inbox, calendar,
      monitoring), `quiet_hours` config, proactive outreach, history (currently only a scheduler task type).
- [ ] **Sub-agent named sessions** — `spawn_child_session()`, labels, inter-session messaging, timeouts, result callbacks, GUI monitor.
- [ ] **TTS multi-provider** — add ElevenLabs + local Piper (only OpenAI wired); per-channel TTS config; voice-note sending; audio cache.
- [ ] **Browser relay Chrome extension** (Low/High) — MV3 extension ↔ daemon relay (proposed port 5150),
      feed the LLM the accessibility tree (not raw DOM); tools `browser_relay_{snapshot,action,screenshot}`.
- [ ] **Paired devices / nodes** — defer to P9 (Tor P2P) rather than a standalone mDNS/WebSocket scheme.
- [ ] Gateway control: `/restart` + `/status` as channel commands, full backup/restore archive, self-update via GitHub releases.

### P9 — Multi-Device Swarm (Tor P2P) 🌱 (not started)
Personal device mesh over Tor hidden services — zero-config, encrypted, no port forwarding. Every
daemon gets a persistent Ed25519 identity + `.onion` address; peers invoke each other's tools
(`remote:phone:camera_snap`). **Tor communication is built on [`onyums`](https://github.com/basic-automation/onyums)**
(arti-backed axum-over-Tor, MIT — same ecosystem as the `arti-axum` repo): it bundles the Tor client,
serves an axum `Router` as a **v3 hidden service**, derives a stable `.onion` from the identity key,
and ships TLS, QR address output, abuse defense, and client authorization out of the box — so we do
**not** hand-roll arti / `tor-hsservice`. New crates:
- [ ] **`nanna-identity`** — Ed25519 keypair custody + fingerprint (`XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`),
      encrypted-at-rest `~/.nanna/identity.json` (Argon2 KDF + AES-256-GCM, zeroized). The stable `.onion`
      is derived from this key by onyums (`tor_hscrypto`).
- [ ] **`nanna-tor`** (thin, onyums-backed) — expose the daemon's axum surface as a Tor v3 hidden
      service via `OnionService::builder().router(app).nickname(..).serve()`; report bootstrap/reachability
      from onyums `status_events()`; TLS `Upgrade`/`Strict`; outbound `.onion` requests via onyums'
      re-exported `arti_client`. Feature-flagged (arti adds ~10–20MB). Far smaller than hand-rolling arti.
- [ ] **`nanna-mesh`** — QR / `nanna://pair` discovery (peers in `~/.nanna/peers.toml`) via onyums'
      `OnionAddress::qr_terminal()` / `qr_svg()`; signed JSON tool_request/response protocol; default-deny
      trust model (`ToolPolicy`, require_approval, per-peer rate limit) that leans on onyums' built-in
      **abuse defense** (proof-of-work / rate-limit / WAF "Skin") and **v3 client authorization**
      (restricted discovery) for the transport-level allowlist; audit log; relay wiring remote tools into the local registry.
- [ ] **GUI** — peer management page, identity management (view/rotate/export), Tor status widget
      (onyums `status()` / `status_events()`), QR pairing.
- [ ] **Claude Code / external-agent bridge** — HTTP/SSE transport on the MCP server + peer-tool registration + auth.
- [ ] Key rotation announcement, identity backup (BIP-39?), Tor-state caching, mobile (arti on Android) investigation.
- [ ] *(research 2026-07-16)* **onyums is alive and healthy — the P9 bet still holds.** Latest commit
      **2026-07-14**, latest published **0.3.1 (2026-06-18)**. Two concrete facts for when we wire it: (1) it
      pins **arti 0.43.0** across `arti-client`/`tor-hsservice`/`tor-hscrypto`/etc., while **arti-client 0.44.0
      shipped 2026-06-30** — onyums is **one minor behind**, so do *not* pin arti 0.44 ourselves and expect it
      to unify (take arti transitively via onyums, exactly as Appendix C says). (2) New since 0.3.0: a
      `crates/onyums-skin` workspace member — pure-Rust WAF (regex signatures), `governor` rate limiting, and an
      **optional Equi-X PoW backend behind an `equix` feature that is LGPL-3.0 and off by default** — keep it
      off unless we accept copyleft. It also now ships a vanity `.onion` miner and pure-Rust QR (`qrcode`,
      `default-features = false`, no `image`/FFI) — matching the "no C where avoidable" doctrine.

### P10 — Token Efficiency & Cost Optimization ✅ (mostly)
Done: Anthropic + OpenAI native prompt caching + hit tracking, cross-provider model routing with
complexity classifier + tool-call-only routing + first-message override, aggressive tool-output
summarization, progressive distillation (rolling summary every N turns), tool-result eviction, CDC
message-level dedup, per-model stats tracker + persistence + stats-informed routing.
- [x] **LLMLingua-style prompt compression** *(2026-07-16)* — `nanna-agent::compressor` scores sentences
      via the configured summarization model, keeps top-`1/ratio` by density (head/tail fallback); tier-1
      proactive pass rewrites large older tool results before `drop_oldest`. (Sentence-level, not per-token.)
- [x] **Structured tool output schemas** *(2026-07-17)* — `ToolDefinition::output_schema` +
      `nanna_tools::output`; verbose tools declare schemas, accept `output_mode=text|json`, attach `data`
      via `ToolResult::with_data`. Default stays free-form text.
- [x] **Better token estimation** *(2026-07-07 / 07-17)* — character-class + family-aware estimators
      (English/Code/Auto densities) with per-message framing, plus an exact `tiktoken-rs` path
      (`estimate_tokens_for_model`, default-on `tiktoken` feature); replaces the `len()/4` heuristic.
- [x] **Streaming cache tracking** *(2026-07-06)* — `StreamEvent::MessageStart` carries
      `input_tokens`/`cache_read`/`cache_creation` (from Anthropic `message_start` usage), captured into
      `LlmResult` instead of placeholders.

### P11 — Correctness, Security & Architecture Debt ✅ (backlog drained 2026-07-18)

The near-term correctness/security/debt backlog — **fully drained**. Every item below is done with
tests, **superseded by P16** (which deleted embedded mode), or **handed to its owning flagship phase**.
Kept as a compact ledger; the full dated rationale and `file:line` anchors for each fix live in its commit.

**Security (all done):**
- [x] User-tool path traversal — `validate_tool_name` at the `create_tool` chokepoint (daemon + GUI). *(2026-07-06)*
- [x] Workspace file traversal — `validate_context_filename` guards `save_context_file`. *(2026-07-06)*
- [x] Discord webhook Ed25519 + Slack webhook HMAC-SHA256 verification (constant-time, replay-guarded). *(2026-07-07)*
- [x] Hardened `delete_skill` (symlink/traversal checks before `remove_dir_all`). *(2026-07-14)*
- [x] Memory-extraction prompt-injection fencing (untrusted-conversation markers + forged-fence defang). *(2026-07-06)*

**Correctness (all done):**
- [x] Response healing for malformed LLM JSON — chat tool-args, embeddings, summarization. *(2026-07-15)*
- [x] Stop button preserves partial work in both the UI and the model context. *(2026-07-15)*
- [x] `parse_model_id` infers provider from name prefix (daemon + GUI). *(2026-07-06 / 14)*
- [x] Memory durability & correctness: atomic persistence (temp+rename); dream consolidation is add-then-remove (no cluster loss) and scope-homogeneous (no cross-workspace leak); dream expansion re-embeds; merge folds instead of duplicating; `remember`/`recall` and dreaming are workspace-scoped. *(2026-07-06 → 18)*
- [x] Model-aware context budgets everywhere — `compression_threshold ≤ hard_limit`; `ModelInfo` is the single source (no per-model hardcode tables). *(2026-07-13 → 15)*
- [x] Orphaned-message-on-failure stores a partial reply instead of leaving the user turn unanswered. *(2026-07-15)*
- [x] Wired all `not_implemented` daemon control actions — regenerate, tool enable/disable, channel status, uptime, non-destructive `peek_mailbox`. *(2026-07-06 → 14)*
- [x] Windows service install/uninstall/start/stop via the SCM (platform-aware default args). *(2026-07-17)*
- [x] Live model stats through a shared tracker; single health-server bind serving the live shared state. *(2026-07-11 / 12)*
- [x] MCP server notifications classified + `list_changed` cache invalidation. *(2026-07-06 / 10)*
- [x] JS tools parse real parameter schemas from their manifests. *(2026-07-11)*
- [x] Tool-manager consistency — clone→validate→mutate→save→swap, dup-name reject, enabled-flag reconciliation, unregister cascade, non-string enums preserved. *(2026-07-09 / 10 / 17)*
- [x] `parse_retry_after` non-ASCII byte-offset fix; `LlmClient` cache keyed by a credential fingerprint. *(2026-07-12 / 17)*
- [x] Daemon boot degrades (not fails) without an embedding key — probe via the shared `EmbeddingRouter`. *(2026-07-16)*
- [x] Scripted `exec` honors its `timeout` and kills the process tree on overrun; tools default to the active-workspace dir at boot (not `~`). *(2026-07-17)*
- [x] Deterministic tests — env-flaky keyring fallback + env-race `resolve_tools_dir` fixed; latent test/compile drift repaired; `test-compile.yml` CI smoke check added (first run green, 16m cold). *(2026-07-06 → 17)*
- [x] Python interpreter runs on a sized 256 MiB thread stack with `sys.setrecursionlimit` clamped so it can't abort. The floor is principled — derived from the empirical overflow bisection (release passes at 128 MiB) — and a separate in-process *setup*-stack measurement was found **Windows-infeasible** (paint-and-scan faults on the lazily-committed stack past the guard page; overflow aborts uncatchably — verified), so the size stays anchored to the bisection rather than a magic number. *(2026-07-16 / 18)*

**Architecture (all done, 2026-07-16):** decomposed `gui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `control.rs`, `settings.vue`, and `main.rs` into per-domain modules; unified the embedded↔daemon agent loop onto `AgentService` (later removed wholesale by P16).

**Embedded-mode items — superseded by P16 (2026-07-18):** the GUI embedding-dimension probe, the silent daemon→embedded fallback, `recall`-broken-in-embedded, and "only three tools in embedded" are all closed by P16's deletion of embedded mode — the GUI is now a pure daemon client, a failed connect is an explicit `Disconnected`, and the daemon loads all 39 skills. The one real remainder — a **local offline embedder** — is a P12 deliverable ("Local embeddings in Burn"); the P11 soft-degrade (actionable `NoEmbeddingProvider`, non-error `recall` result) is done. Stale `9833` sidecar-port doc fixed to `5149`.

**Run-log triage (2026-07-18) — surfaced from a real daemon+GUI run log and fixed this pass:**
- [x] **Multi-tool-call streaming collapse** (OpenAI-compat / OpenRouter) — the agent stream accumulator kept one tool slot and ignored `ToolUseDelta.index`, so ≥2 tool calls per turn concatenated into one mis-attributed buffer (the healer salvaged the first, dropping the rest → the `read_file`/`code_search` "missing parameter" + empty-`exec` storm). Fixed: a per-index `StreamBlockAssembler` finalizes each block on its own `ContentBlockStop`; the OpenAI-compat + Ollama adapters emit stops in ascending index order; `nanna_llm::count_balanced_top_level_objects` flags any residual collapse. 6 attribution tests (fail on the old single-slot code) + 3 heal tests.
- [x] **Tool-stats import made tolerant** — `import_json` deserializes each entry individually (skip+warn on a bad one), backfills the tool name from the map key, and tolerates a scalar `sessions` (the boot `invalid type: integer 202, expected a map`), so one drifted field no longer wipes every model's stats. 4 tests.
- [x] **Corrupt Turso memories table — salvage + surfacing.** The fast single-scan `bulk_load` runs first; only on a corruption error (`is_corruption_error`) does `MemoryRepository::bulk_load_salvage` kick in — reading rowids first (that scan survives a corrupt overflow chain), then loading each row on its own and skipping only the unreadable ones instead of dropping the whole table on the first `?` (so a healthy store keeps its single query, no N+1). A `MemoryStoreHealth { degraded, corrupt_rows, .. }` is recorded on load — and on a whole-store load failure — and surfaced on `/status`, `/health`, and the IPC status action (previously a silent WARN + 0 memories that re-accumulated). Classifier + salvage-equivalence + health-mapping + degraded-on-failure + status-JSON tests. (Whole-btree repair/quarantine remains future work; needs a live corrupt fixture.)
- [x] **Tool-failure log carries the real error** — `result_log_preview` prefers `result.error` (empty for `ToolResult::error`), ending the blank `Tool exec failed in 1ms:` lines. 4 tests.
- [x] **Windows `exec` ergonomics** — `normalize_cmdisms` rewrites the exact cmd.exe idiom `cd /d <path>` → `cd <path>` (the "cd: too many arguments" failure) before Git-Bash routing; the `exec` description + system prompt steer to POSIX and to `code_search` over `rg`. 2 tests.
- [x] **Heartbeat** no longer commands the model to `Read HEARTBEAT.md` (which hard-errored on the missing `~/HEARTBEAT.md`); workspace `HEARTBEAT.md` is already injected via context. 2 tests. (Full retirement of the bespoke file is P17.)
- [x] Removed committed debris `gui/src-tauri/src/_patch.py`.

### P12 — Local Model Runner (Burn) 🌱 flagship (the pivot)
**Goal:** a new `nanna-infer` crate that runs small open models **natively in Rust on a single
consumer GPU** as the default, first-class inference backend — no Ollama, no cloud required. The
local model runs the whole agent loop. Blueprint proven in `physics515/laurelane` (Burn 0.21, from-scratch
Qwen2.5/LFM2/MiniLM, validated on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16GB).

> **Runner extracted → [`physics515/Mummu`](https://github.com/physics515/Mummu).** The generic Burn
> runner (dual wgpu+ndarray backend, from-scratch Qwen2.5/LFM2.5/MiniLM, safetensors weight loading, KV
> cache, on-GPU argmax, streaming, f16, parity gate, model management) now lives in the shared **Mummu**
> repo, which Laurelane and Nanna both consume — **runner increments land in Mummu, not here.**
> `nanna-infer` becomes a **thin consumer**: this phase now tracks only the Nanna-side integration —
> wire Mummu as `Provider::Local` (the top-priority tier in the P10 router), stream its tokens to
> channels + Tauri, and back the memory `embed_fn` + dreaming `summarize_fn` with Mummu embeddings. The
> generic runner items below are the **Mummu contract** (built + tracked there); keep them here only as
> the integration checklist.

- [ ] **Crate `nanna-infer` on Burn** — `burn = { version = "0.21", default-features = false, features = ["std","ndarray","wgpu","fusion","autotune","store"] }`. Model code generic over `B: Backend`.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-07)* Burn 0.21 ships **`burn-dispatch`** (runtime backend selection via `DispatchDevice::Wgpu(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0))`, static-enum dispatch, no perf regression) and **`burn-flex`** (a lightweight *eager* CPU backend — no fusion/autotune — that replaces `burn-ndarray` for WASM/embedded/small-model inference). Evaluate `burn-dispatch` for the "one binary, dual backend, runtime probe" item (may replace the hand-rolled `wgpu::Instance::enumerate_adapters` probe) and `burn-flex` vs `ndarray` for the CPU-fallback tier and the local MiniLM embedder. Also: up to 8× lower framework overhead — meaningful for the small-model decode budget. Sources: [Burn 0.21.0 release](https://burn.dev/blog/release-0.21.0/), [cross-platform GPU backend](https://burn.dev/blog/cross-platform-gpu-backend/).
- [ ] **One binary, dual backend, runtime probe** — compile BOTH `Wgpu` (Vulkan/DX12/Metal, no CUDA toolchain) and `NdArray` CPU; a cheap `wgpu::Instance::enumerate_adapters` probe (cached in `OnceCell`) picks GPU if present, else CPU. No feature-split builds. (laurelane `use_gpu()` pattern.)
- [ ] **First model: a Hermes-class function-calling small model** — a from-scratch Burn decoder (start from laurelane's Qwen2.5 / LFM2 modules: RmsNorm + GQA + RoPE + SwiGLU, tied lm_head) sized for one GPU (1.5–3B). Prove tool-calling quality is good enough to run the loop.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-06)* Evaluate **Qwen 3.5-9B** as the default single-GPU function-calling model — 2026 consensus "sweet spot" (fits ~8GB VRAM, strong tool-call reliability, GGUF Q4 doesn't degrade tool calls). Sources: [insiderllm](https://insiderllm.com/guides/function-calling-local-llms/), [unsloth tool-calling guide](https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/tool-calling-guide-for-local-llms).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-09)* Newer 2026 recommendation for the 8GB tier: **Qwen3-Coder-Next** — an 80B **MoE with only ~3B active params**, so it decodes fast (~40–60 tok/s on a 4090) yet runs Q4 on 8GB+ VRAM, and is now rated best-in-class for *long-horizon tool use + recovery from failed tool calls* (llama.cpp fixed its tool-call parser). Note the MoE/active-param split ties directly to the P12 **`--cpu-moe` expert-offload** and VRAM-budgeting items — the same architecture Nanna's local tier wants. This should become the reference default the Mummu runner targets and the `[infer]` model config points at.

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-07)* Per-tier default: **8GB → Qwen 3.5-9B**, **16GB → Qwen 3.6-35B-A3B with `--cpu-moe`** (MoE expert offload — ties to the VRAM-budgeting item), **24GB → Qwen 3.6-27B dense or 35B-A3B**. Local ~7–9B models **lose coherence after 2–3 tool-chain steps** → bias toward short loops + sub-agent decomposition for the local tier (revisit the iteration cap / swarm hand-off for local models). Sources: [sitepoint 2026](https://www.sitepoint.com/best-local-llm-models-2026/), [insiderllm function-calling](https://insiderllm.com/guides/function-calling-local-llms/).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-12)* **Qwen3.5 GGUF ships universal chat-template fixes for tool-calling** (apply to *any* Qwen3.5 GGUF), and the Qwen3-Coder tool-call parser is now fixed across llama.cpp/Ollama/LMStudio/Jan — de-risks the "reliable tool-call parsing into `ContentBlock::ToolUse`" item for the local tier. When Mummu ports a Qwen3.5-class model, lift its chat template + tool-call grammar verbatim rather than hand-rolling. 8GB tier still wants Q4_K_S/Q4_0 (drop to Q3_K_M on OOM); Qwen3-Coder-Next's ~46GB Q4 footprint keeps it a 16GB+/CPU-offload target, not an 8GB one.

            **bundles a vision encoder that inflates VRAM** — for Nanna's pure-text local tier, pull the

            through 32K (200K+ possible with minor penalty on 8 GB). Bakes into the P12 model-download UX (offer a
            text-only variant + VRAM estimate) and the VRAM-budgeting picker. Reconfirms 8GB→Qwen3.5-9B Q4_K_M as

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-07)* Tool-budget evidence **validates the two-tier tool discovery design**: each tool definition costs ~50–150 tokens; keep the always-sent set **under 5–10 tools** for 7–9B models (Nanna's core-tools-vs-`discover_tools` split already does this). Add a benchmark asserting the local model's active-tool count stays within this budget, and prefer `discover_tools` activation over sending the full registry on the local path.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-16)* **`LFM2.5-8B-A1B` (Liquid AI, 2026-05-28) is now the best primary-source-backed
            8GB pick** — 8B total / **1B active** MoE, **under 6 GB at standard quantization**, day-one llama.cpp
            support + official GGUF. BFCLv3 **64.36**, BFCLv4 **48.50**, τ²-telecom 88.07. **Caveat that lands on
            us:** it emits **Pythonic** function calls (a Python list between special tokens), *not* JSON tool
            blocks — the local tool-call parser needs a shim, unlike Qwen3.5. Compare against **Qwen3.5-9B**
            (BFCL-V4 **66.1**, τ²-bench 79.1, 262K native context) which scores higher but is dense (~6 GB Q4_K_M,
            tighter on 8 GB) and has **thinking mode on by default** (`<think>`) that must be disabled for tool
            loops. Note **Qwen3.6 has no sub-10B model** (35B-A3B / 27B only), so it is not an 8GB option.

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-16)* **Burn is still 0.21.0 (2026-05-07) — no 0.22**, so the 0.21 notes below remain
            current. Two corrections for the Mummu contract: **there is no KV-cache API in Burn 0.21** (searched
            release notes; must be hand-rolled), and **`burn-lm`** (Tracel's own LLM engine) is **alpha and not a
            viable dependency** — only v0.0.1 published, last commit 2026-06-08, models limited to Llama 3.x /
            TinyLlama. Quantization is **not** new in 0.21 (shipped in 0.19). What 0.21 *does* add for inference:
            `attention()` with `scale`/`attn_bias`/`softcap`/`is_causal`, flash attention with causal masking, and
            attention autotune. Adoption breakage to expect: `TensorData::shape` is now `Shape` (old
            `BinFileRecorder` records are not forward-compatible). Sources:

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-06)* Investigate **MoE + expert CPU-offload** (`--cpu-moe`-style) so a larger agentic model (e.g. Qwen 3.6-A3B) fits a 16GB card — relevant to the single-GPU VRAM budgeting item. Also note the model-specific tool-call parser pattern (Qwen ships `qwen3_coder`) for reliable parsing into `ContentBlock::ToolUse`.
- [ ] **Weight loading** — HF safetensors via `burn-store` `SafetensorsStore` + `PyTorchToBurnAdapter` + a `CastFloatAdapter` (bf16→f32/f16); checked load (fail on missing/unused keys). Stream weights from HF to a per-user model cache (resume `.part`, resources-dir first).
- [ ] **Tokenization + chat format** — HF `tokenizers` crate; ChatML (or the chosen model's) template built explicitly; correct special/EOS tokens.
- [ ] **Fast decode** — per-layer KV cache (+ conv-state cache for hybrid models like LFM2); on-device `argmax` so only the winning index syncs to CPU; sampling (temp/top-p) beyond greedy; **streaming tokens** to Tauri events + channels; cooperative interrupt check between tokens (cancellation).
- [ ] **Single-GPU VRAM budgeting** — a size-tier picker (larger model on GPU, smaller on CPU) and an opt-in **f16** path (`Wgpu<half::f16, i32>`) to ~halve VRAM; account for KV cache + display headroom (3B f32 ~12GB is tight on 16GB).
- [ ] **Local embeddings** — a from-scratch MiniLM-class sentence-embedder in Burn (ndarray/CPU) to serve the memory `embed_fn` fully offline (replaces the API `EmbeddingClient` on the local path). Fixes the "no local embeddings" gap.
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-18)* **MiniLM may be an outdated target — evaluate a 2026 on-device embedder
            instead.** Concrete candidates, smallest-first: **Nomic Embed v2 (137M, CPU-friendly, best
            quality-to-size)**; **EmbeddingGemma-300M** (Google, derived from Gemma 3, runs <200 MB quantized,
            ~22 ms/embed on EdgeTPU, strong multilingual + MTEB-Code 68.76 — a natural fit since Mummu will
            already port Gemma/Qwen-class decoders, so the tokenizer/weight-loading path is shared); and
            **Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B** (matryoshka dims, 100+ languages incl. code, pairs with the Qwen3.5
            generation tier). Decision inputs: pick by (a) whether Mummu can reuse the model's decoder blocks,
            (b) output dimension vs the memory store's dimension-agnostic path (already handled by
            `probe_and_align_dimension`), (c) CPU decode latency for the dreaming `embed_fn` batch. This is
            the real fix for the P11 "recall broken in embedded mode / no local embedder" gap. Sources:

- [ ] **Wire in as `Provider::Local`** — add the variant to `nanna-llm::Provider`, dispatch `complete`/stream/tool-calling to `nanna-infer`; make it the **top-priority tier** in the P10 complexity router so cloud is opt-in escalation. Parse tool-calls from local model output into the existing `ContentBlock::ToolUse` shape.
- [ ] **Correctness gate** — parity-test each Burn port against a reference (Candle or a local Ollama run of the same model): single-forward top-k logits + a short greedy sequence must match. This is how laurelane trusts its reimplementations.
- [ ] **Model management UX** — GUI: browse/download/select model, tier + f16 toggles, VRAM estimate, download progress; config `[infer]` section (model repo, cache dir, device override, f16).
- [ ] Later: training/fine-tune loop (Burn supports it); LoRA adapters; quantization (int8/int4) for bigger models on the same GPU; vision/OCR models on the same runner (retire the Candle OCR path).

### P13 — Memory & Dreaming: the moat (Turso-only + DSP time-series) 🌱 flagship (the pivot)
**Goal:** make **dreaming** (cognitive consolidation) the differentiator — a multi-phase, idle-gated,
feedback-driven process, extended with a **DSP-backed event timeline** where time-series compression
*is* the act of forgetting/consolidating. All on Turso, all local.

**Turso-only cleanup (do first — pure hygiene, no engine change):**
- [x] Rename `SqliteMemoryPersistence` → `TursoMemoryPersistence` (`nanna-daemon/src/memory_persistence.rs`; refs in `server.rs`); align with the already-correct `TursoMemoryStorage`.
      *(2026-07-07) Struct renamed (all 5 refs, both files); module doc + the "sqlite datetime format"
      comment de-SQLite'd (no SQL/`.db`/`datetime('now')` changed). Builds green.*
- [x] Purge the word "SQLite" from code comments, log/`warn!` strings, and doc-comments (storage lib.rs/Cargo.toml; daemon persistence/session/control/server; memory service/lib; GUI `sqlite_*` var names) → "Turso"/"the database". **Do not** change SQL, `.db` files, or `datetime('now')`/`AUTOINCREMENT`/`json_*`.
      *(2026-07-06) Done for the **daemon** (server/persistence/session/control/memory_persistence) and **nanna-memory** (service/lib). Left as-is: `nanna-storage/src/lib.rs:6` (a factual "Turso is a Rust-native `SQLite` implementation" — describes SQL-compat, not a mislabel). Remaining: GUI `sqlite_*` var names (need a GUI build to verify).*
      *(2026-07-16) **Closed the GUI slice.** Post-decomposition the remaining references had all landed in one
      file, `gui/src-tauri/src/commands/sessions.rs` (12 occurrences): the two local bindings
      `sqlite_result`/`sqlite_sessions` → `local_result`/`local_sessions`, nine comments → "the local store" /
      "the local Turso store" / "the database", and one **user-visible log string**
      (`"Cleared {} local sessions from SQLite"` → `"… from the database"`). Naming-only: no SQL, `.db` path,
      `datetime('now')`, or control flow touched — the diff is comments + two identifier renames.
      Repo-wide the only surviving "SQLite" is the intentional factual line at `nanna-storage/src/lib.rs:6`,
      exactly as this item specifies. Verified with `cargo check -p nanna-gui` + `cargo test -p nanna-gui`
      (4 pass) — the GUI build needs the sidecar + built frontend staged first (see the build-env note under
      Immediate next actions #2).
- [x] Delete stale `crates/nanna-daemon/src/server.rs.bak`. Pin `turso` precisely (0.x is pre-1.0). Add a CI guard that fails if `rusqlite`/`libsql`/`sqlx` ever enters the dep tree. (Note: a transitive `libsqlite3-sys` comes from RustPython in `nanna-scripting`, separate concern.)
      *(2026-07-06) `server.rs.bak` already absent. `turso` pinned `=0.4.4` in `nanna-storage`. The
      CI guard is a `cargo test` (`nanna-storage/tests/dep_guard.rs`) that scans `Cargo.lock` and fails
      if `rusqlite`/`libsql`/`sqlx` appear (no external CI needed). Also pinned `aegis = "=0.9.7"`
      (transitive via `turso_core`) — 0.9.8+ mandates a clang-cl C build; 0.9.7 keeps the pure-Rust path,
      matching the "prefer pure-Rust, no-C where avoidable" doctrine and keeping stock-MSVC builds green.*

**Best-in-class dreaming:**
- [ ] **Unify the two stacks** — the running app calls low-level `MemoryService::consolidate()` while the richer `DreamingService`/`nanna-core::DreamingRuntime` (feedback, gates, promote/demote) is dead code. Make `DreamingService` the single orchestrator via `create_dreaming_executor`; delete the GUI branch (`lib.rs:8462`) + daemon `MemoryAction::Consolidate` duplication.
> **Dreaming model (do not drift from this):** memories **never expire**. A dream cycle = **semantically
> rank "like" memories → concatenate them → summarize the concatenation into a single memory**
> (`composite_cluster_score` → `MemoryCluster::concatenated_content()` → `create_consolidated_entry`).
> There is no expiry/TTL/purge step. FSRS *retrievability decay* (a memory becoming less retrievable over
> time) is not deletion. See [[nanna-dreaming-model]].

- [~] **Idle-gated, multi-phase dream cycle** (like sleep, not a fixed hourly cron): track last-activity; after N min idle (or memory-pressure) run phases — (a) testing-effect flush, (b) **true merge/dedup**, (c) cluster-consolidate by FSRS weight band (rank-similar → concatenate → summarize), (d) expand high-weight, (e) DSP timeline compression (below). Emit progress events.
      *(2026-07-09)* **Idle gate shipped** (the trigger half). `DreamingService` now tracks `last_activity` (`record_activity()` / `idle_duration()`) and exposes `dream_if_idle()` — the gated entry point the scheduler should call instead of the unconditional `dream()`. Decision lives in a pure, exhaustively-tested `dream_trigger(idle, memory_count, cfg) -> {Idle | MemoryPressure | Skipped}`: runs after `idle_threshold_secs` (default 300s) idle **or** when live memory count hits `memory_pressure_count` (default 5000, `0` disables) — memory-pressure overrides activity so a busy system still consolidates before the store grows unbounded. 4 tests (idle boundary, pressure-overrides-activity, pressure-disabled-by-zero, and `dream_if_idle` skips + never calls `summarize_fn` when active).
      *(2026-07-10)* **Ephemeral memories removed (reverts the mistaken "purge-expired dream phase").** An
      earlier same-day increment wrongly framed purging expired memories as dream "phase (a)"; per the model
      above, memories never expire. Removed the entire TTL/expiry machinery: the `expires_at` column
      (`MIGRATION_009` + index), the `expires_at` fields on `MemoryEntry`/storage `Memory`/`NewMemory`,
      `MemoryEntry::is_expired`, `VectorStore::purge_expired` + `MemoryService::purge_expired`, the search-time
      `is_expired` filter, the `is_expired` skip-reinforce checks, and the `tool_result` 2h-TTL derivation in
      `agent_service.rs` (tool-result memories are now permanent like every other category). The dream cycle
      no longer references expiry. Storage row-decode re-indexed; full non-GUI workspace builds green; memory
      28 / storage / tools 75 / daemon tests pass; clippy dropped in every edited crate (removed code). Note:
      an existing dev DB keeps a harmless unused `expires_at` column (migrations run once by name; fresh DBs
      are clean). Remaining: the rest of the multi-phase body (merge/cluster-by-band/expand/DSP) and wiring
      `record_activity`/`dream_if_idle` into the daemon scheduler + agent loop.
      *(2026-07-13)* **Phase (c) prompt bounded (Tiger-Style safety for the local summarizer).** The greedy
      `cluster_memories` put an **unbounded** number of memories into one cluster, and
      `build_consolidation_prompt` concatenated all of them into a single prompt handed to `summarize_fn` — a
      degenerate weight band of thousands of mutually-similar memories → a >250k-token prompt that overflows a
      small local model's context window (P12). Bounded at cluster *formation* (not prompt building, which
      would silently drop the omitted members' content since `consolidate_cluster` removes every cluster
      member): two `ConsolidationConfig` fields — `max_cluster_memories` (64, a coarse safety cap) and
      `max_cluster_content_bytes` — cap each cluster; a candidate that would breach either bound stays
      unassigned and re-clusters on a later seed, so **no content is dropped** — the band just consolidates
      over more passes. Both carry `#[serde(default)]`; pre/postcondition `debug_assert`s prove every cluster
      honors both bounds.
      *(2026-07-13, model-aware update)* The byte budget is now **sized to the summarizer model's real context
      window**, not a fixed "8 GB tier" constant. New pure `cluster_content_bytes_for_context(tokens)` reserves
      instruction/framing + output headroom, then converts the remaining token budget to bytes at the token
      estimator's **worst-case density** — `nanna_llm::estimate_tokens` counts any non-ASCII char as 1 token and
      the smallest non-ASCII UTF-8 char is 2 bytes, so **2 bytes/token provably cannot overflow the token
      budget for any script**. `ConsolidationConfig::with_summarizer_context_window(tokens)` applies it;
      `default()` uses the same formula at an 8k fallback (`FALLBACK_SUMMARIZER_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS`) for
      when the model is unknown. New `nanna_llm::model_context_window(name)` resolves the window from the
      existing fallback table (no async fetch); both daemon paths — the scheduled task (`server.rs`) and the
      IPC `MemoryAction::Consolidate` (`control.rs`) — size the budget to their summarizer model, so a big-context
      model consolidates more per pass while a small one stays safe. **12 tests total** (count/byte bound +
      lossless; budget scales with window & fits it at worst-case density; tiny-window floor; builder sizing;
      default==fallback formula; `model_context_window` resolution; daemon threads the window). 40 nanna-memory
      + 19 nanna-llm + 42 nanna-daemon lib tests green, zero net new clippy warnings, full workspace builds
      green, real daemon boot reaches "Daemon ready". Remaining: the GUI-embedded consolidation still uses the
      `default()` fallback budget (needs a GUI build to thread its model window).
      *(2026-07-13)* **Scheduled dream cycle now honors the user's memory-compression config.** The daemon's
      automatic hourly consolidation built `ConsolidationConfig::default()` (`server.rs`), silently ignoring
      `[memory] max_compression_ratio` / `min_remaining_memories` — while the IPC-triggered path (`control.rs`)
      read them. Worse, `DaemonBuilder::from_nanna_config` never mapped those two settings onto `DaemonConfig`
      at all, so the scheduled cycle always used the 0.50 / 20 defaults regardless of user config. Fixed:
      added `memory_max_compression_ratio` / `memory_min_remaining_memories` to `DaemonConfig` (both
      construction sites are compiler-enforced), mapped them from `config.memory.*` in `from_nanna_config` and
      the legacy `src/main.rs` path, and routed the scheduled task through a pure, unit-tested
      `scheduled_consolidation_config(max_ratio, min_remaining)` helper (mirrors the `control.rs` build) so
      automatic and manual consolidation are now in lock-step. 2 tests (helper threads the values while keeping
      the new cluster-size defaults; `DaemonConfig::default` mirrors `ConsolidationConfig::default`); 41 daemon
      lib tests green, zero new clippy warnings (2067 baseline unchanged), real daemon boot reaches "Daemon
      ready" + schedules the consolidation task cleanly.
      *(2026-07-19)* **Idle gate now WIRED into the daemon scheduler** (closes the "trigger exists but nothing
      calls it" half). The scheduled `memory_consolidation` task ran `MemoryService::consolidate()`
      **unconditionally every hour** regardless of activity — the shipped `dream_if_idle` gate was dead code
      from the daemon's view. Now: a lock-free monotonic `ActivityClock` (`nanna-daemon::activity`, 8-byte
      `AtomicU64` from a base `Instant`) is stamped by the control plane on **every `Action::Chat`** (user +
      channel; status/log/config polls deliberately excluded so a 1 Hz GUI poll can't hold the gate shut), and
      the scheduled dream cycle gates on `nanna_memory::dream_trigger(clock.idle(), memory.count(), cfg)` — the
      **same pure policy** `DreamingService::dream_if_idle` uses (exported from `nanna-memory`, one source of
      truth, no drift). Skips with a `"Skipped (active; idle Ns, N memories)"` task result while in use; runs on
      `Idle`/`MemoryPressure`. Two config knobs (`[memory] dream_idle_threshold_secs`=300,
      `dream_memory_pressure_count`=5000) thread through `DaemonConfig` (both construction sites + `from_nanna_config`
      + legacy `serve.rs`). 4 `ActivityClock` tests (fresh≈0 idle, idle grows, record resets, shared-Arc monotonic)
      + a `DaemonConfig`-mirrors-`DreamingConfig` mapping test + the 3 existing `dream_trigger` tests still green;
      hermetic `e2e_daemon` (4/4) proves `DaemonServer::run()` boots with the new wiring. Remaining on this item:
      the multi-phase dream *body* (merge/cluster-by-band/expand/DSP) and unifying onto one `DreamingService`
      orchestrator (its own item) so the daemon dreams *through* it rather than the low-level `consolidate()`.
- [x] **Implement the missing true merge** — `IngestAction::Update` currently falls back to create/reinforce (`service.rs:300`); add content-level merge so dreaming deduplicates instead of accreting near-duplicates.
      *(2026-07-07) Done for **all three ingest paths** (`smart_ingest`, `remember_with_importance`,
      the scoped variant) via a shared `fold_into_memory` helper: `merge_memory_content` +
      `update_content_and_embedding` fold related-but-distinct content into the existing memory
      (bounded, superset-dedup) and reinforce FSRS. Next: apply the same merge in the batch
      dreaming/consolidation clusterer (`cluster_memories`), which still creates consolidated copies.*
- [x] **Harden `create_consolidated_entry` against NaN** — the FSRS-scalar merge used
      `max_by(|a,b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())`, which **panics the dreaming cycle** if any stored
      `importance`/`storage_strength` is NaN.
      *(2026-07-09)* Replaced with a pure `max_finite_or(values, default)` that skips non-finite inputs
      (NaN/±inf) and falls back to the default when none are finite; added pre/postcondition assertions
      (non-empty cluster in, finite scalars out). 3 unit tests (NaN/inf skipped, max+sum semantics,
      NaN-cluster survives). Removes two prod-path `unwrap`s from the consolidation path.
- [ ] **Indexed clustering** — replace the O(N²) greedy single-pass `cluster_memories()` with HNSW/IVF candidate neighbors + connected-components/HDBSCAN over `composite_cluster_score`; scales past the ~50k in-RAM ceiling.
      - *(2026-07-12, partial)* Interim: the clusterer's per-pair `cosine_similarity` (called O(N²) times per
        band) now delegates to `nanna_simd::cosine_similarity_f32` (AVX-512/AVX2/NEON) — the same primitive the
        vector-search path already uses — instead of a private scalar loop, removing the duplication. Guards
        preserve the "0.0 on mismatch/empty" contract (`nanna_simd` panics on unequal lengths and NaNs on a
        zero-magnitude vector; the clusterer's existing `.max(0.0)` already tolerated it, but the guard makes it
        explicit). Parity test vs a scalar reference over random 768-dim vectors (<1e-4) + zero/mismatch/empty
        edge tests. **The O(N²) structure itself is unchanged — HNSW candidate-neighbor work is still open.**
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-06)* Use a **pure-Rust HNSW** crate (`hnsw_rs` / `instant-distance`) over a C ext — `sqlite-vec` is brute-force only; `vectorlite` shows HNSW at `ef_construction=100, M=30` scales well. Fits the Turso-only + in-RAM-cosine model (build the index in RAM, persist coeff/graph as Turso BLOBs). Sources: [vectorlite](https://github.com/1yefuwang1/vectorlite), [sqlite-vec ANN issue](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/issues/25).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-09)* Crate shortlist (all pure-Rust, actively maintained early 2026): **`hnsw_rs`** — multithreaded build/search via `parking_lot`, SIMD distances through `anndists` (L1/L2/Cosine/Hamming/…), the most feature-complete; **`hnswlib-rs`** — designed for **concurrent search + concurrent mutation** with an `InMemoryVectorStore` doing **lock-free reads + parallel updates** (best fit for a live memory store that dreams while serving recalls, avoids a global rebuild); **`instant-distance`** — smallest/simplest pure-Rust HNSW if we want minimal surface. Lean `hnswlib-rs` for the online/insert-while-query case, `hnsw_rs` if we need its distance breadth. Sources: [hnsw_rs](https://crates.io/crates/hnsw_rs), [hnswlib-rs](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/hnswlib-rs), [instant-distance](https://lib.rs/crates/instant-distance).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-10)* Confirmed still current: `hnsw_rs` exposes `insert_parallel` + `parallel_search` (rayon/parking_lot) — the concrete entry points for the "batch-build the index in RAM from the whole `VectorStore`, then query candidates" approach that fits the dream-time clusterer (build once per cycle rather than incrementally). `instant-distance` builds from a `Vec<Point>` in one shot (no incremental insert) — fine for the rebuild-per-dream model, wrong for online mutation. Net: `hnsw_rs::Hnsw::insert_parallel` for the dream-time rebuild; revisit `hnswlib-rs` only if we later need insert-while-serving. Sources: [hnsw_rs docs](https://docs.rs/hnsw_rs/latest/hnsw_rs/hnsw/index.html), [instant-distance](https://github.com/djc/instant-distance).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-11)* `hnsw_rs` still actively maintained (crates.io updated 2026-02-28) and now
            documents **in-search filtering** — pass either a sorted `Vec` of allowed ids or a filter closure
            evaluated *before* an id enters the result set (not a post-filter). This is the clean primitive for
            **workspace-scoped recall over one shared index**: keep a single HNSW of all memories and filter to
            the active workspace's ids at query time, instead of rebuilding a per-workspace index — directly
            useful for the P11 "tool-memory workspace scope" item too. Source: [hnsw_rs docs](https://docs.rs/hnsw_rs/latest/hnsw_rs/hnsw/index.html).
      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-16, corrects the crate shortlist)* Two of the three shortlisted crates need
            re-reading. **`instant-distance` is dormant — rule it out**: no release since **0.6.1 (June 2023)**
            despite repo activity, so the "smallest/simplest pure-Rust HNSW" option is not a live choice.
            **`hnswlib-rs` 0.10.0 (2026-01-05) is a *different crate* than the 2026-07-13 note assumed** — it is
            not jean-pierreBoth's; it is a pure-Rust port from the **CoreNN** project (wilsonzlin/corenn). The
            storage-decoupling property still holds and still suits our Turso-backed store. **`hnsw_rs` 0.3.4
            (2026-02-28)** remains current and published (0.3.5 is in `Changes.md` but **unpublished**); its
            `modify_level_scale` (0.3.1) buys better recall, or equal recall at smaller `max_nb_conn` (less RAM).
            Also worth evaluating before we build: **CoreNN** itself — an embeddable pure-Rust vector DB with
            built-in **per-vector int8 quantization** (`insert_qi8`) + f16/bf16 inserts, which overlaps the
            "f16 embedding compression" backlog item. Ruled out: `usearch` (C++ w/ Rust bindings — fails the
            pure-Rust preference); `rust-diskann` 0.3.5 is experimental (~890 downloads). Decision unchanged:
            `hnsw_rs::insert_parallel` for the rebuild-per-dream clusterer. Sources:

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-13)* **`hnswlib-rs` (Jan-2026 rewrite) decouples the graph from vector storage**:
            the `Hnsw` struct owns only the graph + an external-key→dense-`NodeId` map, while the caller supplies a
            `VectorStore` keyed by `NodeId`; its `InMemoryVectorStore` does **lock-free reads + parallel updates**,
            built explicitly for *concurrent search while mutating*. This is the cleaner fit than `hnsw_rs` **if**
            we want the index to live persistently and serve recalls while dreaming inserts/mutates — the memory
            store already separates embeddings (Turso BLOBs) from the search structure, so a `NodeId→memory-id`
            map drops in without duplicating vectors. Decision stands: `hnsw_rs::insert_parallel` for a
            rebuild-per-dream clusterer (simpler), `hnswlib-rs` only when we move to a long-lived insert-while-serve
            index. Source: [hnswlib-rs](https://crates.io/crates/hnswlib-rs).
- [ ] **Feedback-driven FSRS** — wire real signals (thumbs, corrections, tool-success/failure) into `DreamingService::record_feedback` so importance is learned, not static.
      *(2026-07-13)* **Feedback accumulator hardened + boost table de-duplicated.** `record_feedback`'s
      `pending_feedback` (`memory_id → Vec<MemoryFeedback>`) was an **unbounded** per-memory accumulator on the
      live service path — a feedback flood between dream cycles grew it without limit (Tiger Style: bound
      everything). Also extracted the ±0.3/0.5 boost table (duplicated verbatim in `apply_feedback` and the
      dream-time aggregation) into one `const fn feedback_boost` so the immediate and deferred paths can't
      drift. (Prereq for the real signal wiring, which is the remaining work here.)
      *(2026-07-13, reworked — bounded by construction, no arbitrary cap)* The first pass capped the `Vec` at a
      retain-16 constant and claimed losslessness — **wrong for mixed-direction floods**: 16 positives followed
      by 20 strong negatives would drop the negatives past the cap and flip the applied sign (+1.0 instead of
      the true −1.0). Since the dream loop only ever consumes the **aggregate sum** (commutative), the signals
      never need retaining at all: `pending_feedback` is now `memory_id → FeedbackTally` — four saturating
      per-variant `u32` counters (a fixed **16 bytes per memory** regardless of flood volume; counters saturate
      at ~4.3 B instead of wrapping). `total_boost()` = Σ count × `feedback_boost(variant)` via fused
      `mul_add` — exactly the signal-by-signal sum, every signal counted, no drop policy, no magic number. 4
      tests (mixed-direction flood → all 36 signals counted, fixed 16-byte accumulator, exact −5.2 aggregate
      with the correct sign; tally == signal-by-signal reference sum; saturate-not-wrap; boost signs). 38
      nanna-memory tests green, net −2 clippy warnings, full workspace builds green, real daemon boot healthy.

            Now that the default `w20` is the correct FSRS-6 value (fixed 2026-07-17), the eventual "learn the
            params from history" step has a ready tool: `fsrs-rs` (6.6.x, 2026-06) exposes
            `FSRS::compute_parameters(ComputeParametersInput) -> Result<Parameters>`, fed a `Vec<FSRSItem>` where
            each `FSRSItem` is a review vector of `FSRSReview { rating, delta_t }`. Our `FsrsState.access_count` +
            the testing-effect `record_access` history is exactly that review stream (map `Rating`→FSRS rating,
            elapsed-days→`delta_t`); persist per-memory review logs, batch them, call `compute_parameters` during a
            dream cycle, and replace `FsrsParameters::default()` with the fitted set. Caveat: `fsrs-rs`'s trainer is
            **Burn-backed** (per the crate's "full training support using Burn" description) — pulling it in adds
            Burn to `nanna-memory`'s tree, so gate adoption on whether the P12/Mummu Burn stack is already a
            workspace dependency by then (don't add a second heavy ML dep just for this). Validate any fitted set
            through the retention harness before it becomes the default, same gate the w20 flip used. Sources:

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-16)* **FSRS-7 exists, but is not reachable from Rust yet — do not plan on it.**
            The benchmark repo documents FSRS-7 as the newest version (first to handle **fractional intervals**;
            forgetting curve now has **8 optimizable parameters**; the only version with realistic same-day-review
            predictions). **However `fsrs-rs` is 6.6.1 (2026-06-09) and implements FSRS-6** — FSRS-7 support is
            **PR #395, open since 2026-04-07 and still unmerged**, blocked on upstream formula work. So adopting
            FSRS-7 means vendoring an unmerged PR; staying on FSRS-6 is the correct default until it lands.
            (Explicitly unverified: the claim that "FSRS-7 is final" traces to no primary source — Expertium's own
            Algorithm page still documents FSRS-6 only.) Sources:

      - [ ] *(research 2026-07-16)* **We ship the FSRS-6 curve with the FSRS-5 decay constant — `w20` is wrong
            by ~7.6x.** `nanna-memory/src/fsrs.rs` implements the FSRS-6 forgetting curve *exactly*
            (`R(t,S) = (1 + factor·t/S)^(-w20)` with `factor = 0.9^(-1/w20) - 1`, `power_law_retrievability`),
            but defaults `w20: 0.5` — commented "typically 0.5", which is in fact **FSRS-4.5/5's hardcoded
            `DECAY = -0.5`**, not an FSRS-6 value. **FSRS-6's default `w20` is `0.0658`**; making that exponent
            trainable is the entire point of the version we claim to implement. A 0.5 exponent decays
            retrievability far faster than FSRS-6 intends, so every consumer of retrievability is skewed:
            testing-effect reinforcement, the FSRS weight bands the dream cycle clusters by, and
            `retrieval_strength`. **Do not blind-flip the constant**: it changes live memory behavior, so land
            it behind the **memory retention harness** (recall before/after a dream cycle) already listed under
            *Performance & Benchmarking* — that harness is the instrument that tells us whether 0.0658 actually
            recalls better, and it is exactly the "measure, don't guess" case. Then fit `w0..w20` from the
            accumulated access history rather than any static default (see the 2026-07-06 note above).

      - [x] *(2026-07-17)* **Measured, then flipped — `FsrsParameters::default().w20` is now `0.0658`.**
            `nanna-memory::retention::measure_gated_recall` measures recall through the FSRS-gated
            `MemoryService::recall` path (the one that drops memories whose `weight = retrievability × importance`
            is below `min_weight`), so it is `w20`-sensitive unlike raw vector recall. The `w20_experiment_aged_recall`
            test replays one aged corpus (800 days, uniform importance, `stability = 1`) under both exponents:
            **`w20 = 0.5` recalls 0/6 topics** (every valid memory decays below the weight gate and vanishes) while
            **`w20 = 0.0658` recalls 6/6** — the "recalls better" proof the flip was gated on. With that evidence
            the default was flipped `0.5 → 0.0658` (the correct FSRS-6 value; `0.5` was FSRS-4.5/5's `DECAY`
            mispaired with the FSRS-6 curve, decaying ~7.6x too fast). Blast radius verified contained: the only
            w20-sensitive tests are `fsrs.rs` (monotonic decay / literal-accessibility state / stability updates —
            all w20-agnostic) and the retention consolidation test (re-baselined — under slower decay a corpus must
            age past a year and hold uniform importance to reach a compressible band; still 60→6, recall 1.0→1.0).
            nanna-memory 53 / nanna-agent 61 / nanna-core 23 / nanna-daemon 54 tests green. Remaining: *fit*
            `w0..=w20` from access history instead of any static default (the eventual FSRS-6 trainable goal).

      Now that the daemon actually dreams only during a lull (idle gate wired 2026-07-19), the 2026 literature
      (Letta's sleep-time compute, arXiv:2504.13171; the SCM "sleep-consolidated memory" and 9-stage consolidation
      papers) points at the next lever: during idle, don't *only* rank-similar→concatenate→summarize — also
      **rewrite raw context into "learned context"** (pre-organize/pre-answer likely future queries) so wake-time
      responses are cheaper. Reported effect: ~5x less test-time compute for equal accuracy, ~2.5x lower cost/query
      when amortized across related queries. Two concrete, in-reach steps for Nanna: (a) a dream phase that
      **promotes recurring episodic memories to semantic/fact memories** (maps onto the P13 "episodes consolidate
      into facts" line and the DSP peak-detection item), and (b) let the dream cycle use a **stronger model than the
      chat model** — it has no latency constraint — which our `summarization_priority` list already allows; make the
      dream path prefer it explicitly. Gate any change through the retention harness. Sources:

      agent-prompt arm, so the daemon's own **heartbeat/cron/task agent runs** also count as activity — a dream
      cycle defers while an autonomous run is in progress. Safe against starvation: heartbeats are infrequent
      (30 min) vs the 5-min idle threshold, and the memory-pressure trigger still overrides. (The
      `memory_consolidation` task itself is a separate named arm, so it never self-stamps.)

- [ ] **Resample the timeline into per-signal series** — salience(t), access-rate(t), emotional valence(t), per-cluster topic-activation(t).
- [ ] **DSP compression = dreaming over time** — keep the recent window at full sample rate; for older windows decimate/wavelet-drop low-energy detail with the **keep-rate driven by FSRS `power_law_retrievability`** — sharp near-term detail, blurred long-term gist.

### P14 — Long-Horizon Autonomy on a Small Local Model ✅ (harness + first live on-model baseline landed 2026-07-18; full eval suite open)

**Goal:** a 7–9B local model that stays on task for **hours**, not 2–3 tool calls, at a token cost that a
single GPU can actually sustain. P12 gives us a model that *runs*; this phase is what makes it *useful*.
Everything here is testable **today against Ollama** — none of it waits on Mummu.

**The problem, stated honestly.** Our own research already says local ~7–9B models *"lose coherence after
2–3 tool-chain steps"* (P12, 2026-07-07). A frontier model survives long tasks by brute context: it
re-reads a 200k-token history and re-derives intent every turn. A local model has neither the window nor
the tok/s to do that. So long-horizon capability cannot come from the model — it has to come from the
**harness**. The design bet: *the agent should never need to remember; the harness should make forgetting
survivable.* Two goals that sound opposed — hours of coherence, few tokens — are the same goal, because
**the way you burn tokens is by re-establishing context you failed to persist.**

**Governing metric:** *task success @ tokens* — fraction of a long-task eval suite completed, over total
tokens spent. Not tok/s, not context size. A run that finishes in 40k tokens beats one that finishes in
400k, and both beat one that drifts. Ties into the P-&-B *agent-eval suite* (that suite is the denominator).

**Landed (2026-07-18):** the whole harness ships in `nanna-agent/src/harness.rs` (the engine:
`LongHorizonRunner` over two traits, `TaskSource` + `StepRunner`, so the control loop is
deterministically testable without a model — 20+ tests incl. the Suite 4 fixtures) with daemon
production impls in `nanna-daemon/src/tasks.rs` (`TursoTaskSource`, `AgentStepRunner` = fresh
`Agent` + empty context per step, `TaskRunManager` for background runs) and IPC surface
`TaskAction::StartRun/RunStatus/CancelRun` + `TaskRun*` events. The live on-model eval passes
**5/5 @ 22.6k tokens/item on qwen3.5:9b** after same-day harness tuning (see the benchmark items
below); what remains open is the full eval build-out (published task set, pass^k, 8 GB tier).

**Design spine — externalize state, keep the window tiny:**
- [x] **The todo store *is* the agent's working memory** (P15) — *(2026-07-18)* a run is a loop over
      `next()`; each step's prompt carries only the current task, its acceptance check, its recent
      notes, and the last result. The model's job is "advance one step".
- [x] **Re-anchor, don't re-read.** *(2026-07-18)* Every step runs in a **fresh agent context**
      (`AgentStepRunner` builds a new `Agent` + empty `AgentContext` per step) — long-run context is
      O(1) by construction, not by compression. Findings persist via task notes (append-only,
      16 KiB bound), not the transcript. Validated by research: "self-conditioning" (arXiv 2509.09677)
      shows models err more when their own past errors stay in context, and it is NOT fixed by scale.
- [x] **One tool per step, chosen from ≤5.** *(2026-07-18)* Per-item `tools:` hint on the task row →
      `RunOptions.initial_active_tools`; the step activates exactly the scoped set (+ `todo`, its only
      memory) instead of the registry. `discover_tools` stays available as the escape hatch.
- [x] **Sub-agent per subtask, fresh context, structured return.** *(2026-07-18)* The engine sees only
      `StepOutcome` (text + token counts + tool-call *digests*) — the parent's context cannot grow
      when a step runs, structurally.
- [x] **Checkpoint + resume across restarts.** *(2026-07-18)* The task store **is** the checkpoint:
      every mutation is durable in Turso at the moment it happens, so resuming after a crash/reboot is
      just `StartRun` on the same scope — `next()` picks up exactly where the plan stands, no replay.
      (Run *counters* — tokens spent so far — reset on restart; the plan and all notes do not.)

**Staying on track (drift is the real enemy, not context length):**
- [x] **Acceptance check per todo item.** *(2026-07-18)* `AcceptanceCheck` (command exit-0 /
      file_exists / regex over file-or-command-output, timeout-bounded) runs **in the harness** after
      every step; with a check present, the environment is the only judge — a `TASK COMPLETE` claim
      that the check refutes is counted as a `false_success_claim` and logged, never recorded as done.
      The `tasks.done` service and GUI `Done` action gate the same way, so the model can't route
      around it. Shape validated at write time by the store.
- [x] **Progress-or-replan.** *(2026-07-18)* N steps (default 5) with no check flipping ⇒ a `Plan`-kind
      replan step that decomposes the item into subtasks *in the store* (via the todo tool — no plan
      parsing); after `max_replans_per_item` (default 2) the item is abandoned (cancelled + reason in
      the activity log) and the run moves on. Grinding is bounded by construction — see the drift
      containment row in `bench/BASELINE.md` Suite 4.
- [x] **Loop/repetition detector.** *(2026-07-18)* Two signals, per the research (hash-identical loops
      and semantically-varied flailing are different failure modes): in-run, same tool + same args +
      same result twice ⇒ one corrective nudge (`detect_tool_call_loop`, next to the narration/spiral
      detectors); cross-step, an identical tool-call signature two steps running doubles the stall
      counter, accelerating replan/abandon.
- [x] **Bounded blast radius.** *(2026-07-18)* Per-run caps on wall-clock, total tokens, and (loop-level)
      tool calls — `RunOptions.max_wall_clock`/`max_tool_calls` + harness `max_wall_clock`/
      `max_total_tokens`, all caller-set, no magic defaults at the loop level. The budget is surfaced
      *to the model*: a `== BUDGET ==` line in every step prompt, and the agent loop now injects a
      model-visible status message at 80% of a token budget (previously log-only).
- [x] **The goal is immutable.** *(2026-07-18)* Pinned verbatim at the top of the byte-stable prompt
      prefix of every step; never summarized, never compressed (test-asserted).

**Token economics (measure before optimizing):**
- [x] **Token budget accounting per run** — *(2026-07-18)* `LongHorizonReport.tokens_per_completed_item`
      is the run's governing metric; per-item `tokens_spent` also lands in the completion activity
      detail, so post-mortems can see which item burned the budget. (Note: the roadmap's "CostTracker
      (P6)" never existed as a type — accounting builds on `RunState` token counters + `ModelStatsTracker`.)
- [x] **Prompt-cache the immutable prefix.** *(2026-07-18)* The step prompt is stable-prefix +
      dynamic-tail by construction (`build_step_prompt`): system rules + verbatim goal never move
      (byte-identical across steps, test-asserted — the shape KV-prefix reuse rewards), and the
      current task/verdict/budget ride at the end, in recent attention (the Manus recitation pattern).
- [x] **Ladder the model, don't fix it.** *(2026-07-18)* `StepKind` (plan | execute | verify) threads
      from `RunOptions` into `classify_complexity`/`route_model`: Plan ⇒ Complex (biggest model),
      Verify ⇒ Medium, Execute ⇒ the structural heuristic (cheap-model biased); execute steps also skip
      the routing's first-turn-primary rule since every re-anchored step is a "first turn".
- [x] **Stop paying for tool output twice.** *(pre-existing, confirmed)* Per-tool `output:
      context|memory` routing already defaults verbose tools to "chunk to memory + stub in context";
      the task tools declare `output: "context"` so plans are never stubbed away.
- [x] **Benchmark (deterministic half):** *(2026-07-18)* `bench/BASELINE.md` Suite 4 commits
      task-success @ tokens rows from scripted-model fixtures (`cargo test -p nanna-agent harness`):
      compliant runs complete 3/3 at exactly 1200 tokens/item, a perma-false-claiming model admits
      **0** completions and costs ≤ 6000 tokens before abandonment, loops abandon in < 4 steps.
- [x] **Benchmark (live half):** *(2026-07-18, tuned to 5/5 same day)* the harness runs end-to-end
      against a real local model: qwen3.5:9b via Ollama, 5 minutes-scale tasks with machine
      acceptance checks (`nanna-daemon/tests/live_long_horizon.rs`, `#[ignore]`d). Final:
      **5/5 verified-complete @ 22,564 tokens/item in 72 s (6 steps), 0 replans, 0 false-success
      claims admitted** — recorded in `bench/BASELINE.md` Suite 4 with the full tuning trail.
      The eval earned its keep immediately: run 1 (0/5) caught scripted tools loading without the
      registry handle (relative paths silently resolved to `$HOME` — production bug, fixed); run 2
      (3/5) caught the acceptance runner silently falling back to `cmd.exe` when no bare `sh` is on
      PATH (POSIX checks unwinnable — now routed through Git Bash like the exec tool,
      regression-tested) plus Ollama 500s tripping the error breaker (now retried with a fresh
      re-anchored context); run 3 = 5/5.
  - [x] **The "4-hour task", run for real:** *(2026-07-19)* qwen3.5:9b worked ONE seeded plan
        (build `minidb` against 42 fail-to-pass feature tests) for the full **6-hour** wall-clock
        cap — longest unbroken segment **4h39m** after a single healed provider incident — with
        23 verified completions distributed across the whole window, **0 false successes in six
        hours**, and on-plan work still happening at hour six. 5.13M tokens, 137 steps
        (`bench/BASELINE.md` Suite 4, endurance section, incl. the seven-run tuning trail: every
        failed run exposed a real bug — tool workdir plumbing, cmd.exe acceptance fallback,
        Ollama aborted-generation parsing, poison containment, subtask queue-jumping).
  - [x] **Cloud endurance (openrouter/free auto-router):** *(2026-07-20)* the same ladder driven
        through OpenRouter's free tier, where the serving model varies per request — **33/42
        verified in 3.30h, one unbroken segment, 0 resumes, 0 false successes, plan drained**
        (`all_tasks_done`; 12 items abandoned via containment where weak model draws ground out).
        Healing is provider-aware (`ProviderId::from_model` gates local-server surgery to
        Ollama-served models; cloud incidents heal by pause+resume+retries). Recorded in
        `bench/BASELINE.md` Suite 4.
  - [ ] **Live half, remaining:** local-tier throughput (14/42 primary features in 6h — the
        middle-ladder grind dominates), a published task set (Terminal-Bench easy-tier /
        SWE-bench Lite), pass^k on the endurance suite, and the 8 GB reference tier.

- [x] *(research 2026-07-17 → done 2026-07-18)* Cross-checked against published work; the design held
      up and got sharper. Key findings: long-task failure is execution/context, not reasoning —
      "self-conditioning" means fresh minimal context beats a transcript, and scaling doesn't fix it
      (arXiv 2509.09677); "false success" (agent claims done, environment disagrees) is 45–76% of
      failures in several suites and LLM judges barely detect it (AUROC 0.54–0.65) — harness-run
      environment checks are the fix (arXiv 2606.09863, AgentRewardBench); tool-selection accuracy
      collapses >90% → ~13% as tool count grows, specifically for small models (RAG-MCP, MCPVerse);
      goal drift worsens with horizon for every model tested (arXiv 2505.02709); reliability
      (τ-bench pass^k) collapses across repeated trials, so soft nudges through a small model's
      context are weak medicine — enforcement must be harness-side, on objective signals. Prior art
      for store-as-control-structure is rich (Claude Code TodoWrite, Manus todo.md recitation, Beads'
      DB-over-markdown argument, claude-task-master's advisory `testStrategy`) — none combines an
      external store with *harness-executed* acceptance on 7–9B local models; that combination is the
      novel part. Design deltas adopted from the research: the false-success counter, the dual
      repetition signal, replan-splits-tasks (MAST: ~42% of failures are bad decomposition), and
      byte-stable prefix + recency-positioned task (Manus KV-cache lesson).

### P15 — Agent-Grade Task Store (todo as control structure) ✅ (landed 2026-07-18)

**Goal:** replace the flat, session-scoped `todo` skill with a task store an agent can *plan* against and
the harness can *drive* a long run from. This is P14's substrate — the two ship together or neither works.

**What exists** (`crates/nanna-tools/default-skills/todo/tool.ts`, 259 lines, v0.1.0): a flat list in a
per-session JSON file (`.nanna-todo-{session}.json`) with `add/create/done/update/remove/clear/clear_all/
list` and status `pending|in_progress|blocked|done`. That is a **scratchpad**, and its limits are exactly
what breaks long runs: no hierarchy, so a big task cannot be decomposed in place; **no dependencies**, so
`blocked` is a label a model sets by vibes rather than a fact the harness derives; no persistence beyond a
session, so an agent that restarts forgets the plan; no query, so "what is next?" costs a full-list dump
into context every turn; and no acceptance criteria, so *the model decides when it is done*.

**Todoist as the reference feature set** *(2026-07-17 — surveyed [features](https://www.todoist.com/features)
and the [filter syntax](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters-V98wIH))*. It is the
right prior art because it solved "a human keeps hundreds of tasks straight for years" — but the mapping is
not 1:1, and the differences matter more than the similarities:

| Todoist | Take it? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Projects / sections / **sub-tasks** | **Yes** | Hierarchy *is* decomposition; the unit a sub-agent gets |
| **Dependencies / blocking** | **Yes — the big one** | Makes `next()` derivable instead of guessed |
| **Filter query language** (`&`/`\|`/`!`/parens, `today`, `overdue`, `p1`, `@label`, `#project`, `search:`) | **Yes** | An agent that can *query* stops paying to re-read the list |
| Priorities `p1..p4` | Yes | Cheap, and orders `next()` |
| Labels | Yes | Doubles as the per-item **tool scope** hint (P14) |
| Due dates + **natural-language parsing** | Partly | Deadlines matter; NL parsing is a *human* affordance — an agent should emit structured dates. Don't build a date parser for a machine caller |
| Recurring tasks | Yes | Maps onto HEARTBEAT.md / cron (P8) — one recurrence engine, not two |
| Reminders | Reuse | `remind`/`cancel_reminder`/`list_reminders` skills already exist — wire, don't duplicate |
| Comments / attachments | Adapt | Becomes **per-task working notes** — the durable scratchpad P14 needs |
| Activity history | **Yes** | The audit trail of a 4-hour run; also the dataset for "why did it drift?" |
| Karma / productivity charts | **No** | Gamification for humans. An agent needs an acceptance check, not points |
| Collaboration / assignment / roles | **Reframe** | "Assignee" = *which agent* (parent vs sub-agent), not which person |
| Templates | Later | Useful once recurring multi-step jobs exist |
| Views (board/calendar), 80+ integrations | GUI-only | A rendering concern, not agent-facing |

**Build-out (all landed 2026-07-18 — migration `011_tasks`, `TaskRepository` in
`nanna-storage/src/tasks.rs` (24 tests), filter parser in `task_filter.rs` (26 tests), todo skill
v0.2.0, `tasks.*` script services + `TaskAction` IPC group + GUI `/tasks` page):**
- [x] **Store in Turso** — `tasks` + `task_notes` + `task_activity` tables (migration `011_tasks`);
      scope `session | workspace | global` with disjoint views, so a plan outlives the chat that made
      it. Integer ids (small-model-friendly; uuids add nothing agent-facing). Turso only, no new store.
      *Learned the hard way:* an unfinished `Rows` cursor on the shared turso connection **silently
      swallows subsequent writes** — drop cursors before writing (found via a vanishing activity row;
      comment at the create() site).
- [x] **Hierarchy** — `parent_id` + `sort_order`; a parent **cannot** complete while a child is open
      (repo-enforced, instructive error), and auto-completes when its last child closes — *unless it
      carries its own acceptance check*, in which case it must be completed explicitly so its check
      runs. Depth bounded at 32 (recursion protection, documented justification). Cancelling a parent
      cascades to its open subtree (children of a dead plan must not surface from `next()`).
- [x] **Dependencies** — `depends_on[]` with cycle check **on write** (BFS over the would-be graph;
      reject self-deps and transitive cycles; parent-chain cycles too). `blocked` is derived at read
      time — writing `status='blocked'` is rejected with "add a dependency instead". Cancelled
      dependencies count as satisfied (a dependent must not block forever on an abandoned item).
- [x] **`next()`** — the one actionable item: open, unblocked, leaf (no open children); ordered
      `in_progress` first (resume what you started), then priority, due date (nulls last), explicit
      order, id. Returned with its acceptance check, tool scope, and a 5-note tail — one item in
      context per turn.
- [x] **Acceptance criteria per item** — `{kind: command|file_exists|regex, ...}`, shape-validated at
      write time so the harness never meets a malformed check; run by the harness / `tasks.done`
      service (see P14). `done` via plain `update` is rejected: "use the done action so the
      acceptance check can run".
- [x] **Filter/query language** — the planned Todoist subset (`&`, `|`, `!`, parens, `p1..p4`,
      `@label`, `#project`, `overdue`, `due before:/after:`, `no date`, `no label`, `search:`,
      `subtask`) plus status atoms (`pending`/`in_progress`/`done`/`cancelled`/`blocked`-as-derived)
      and `today`. Pure recursive-descent parser, zero I/O, bounded input (4 KiB) and depth (32),
      structured ISO dates only (no NL date parser for a machine caller), 26 unit tests incl.
      precedence, no-space colon forms, and adversarial inputs.
- [x] **Working notes per task** — append-only, 16 KiB/note bound (a note-tail injection can never
      exceed ~4k tokens); the harness writes each step's findings here — long-run state lives in the
      store, not the transcript.
- [x] **Activity log** — every transition with actor + timestamp + JSON detail (created / updated /
      completed / auto_completed / cancelled / reopened / acceptance_checked / false_success_claim /
      replanned / abandoned / imported_blocked). This is the drift post-mortem dataset.
- [x] **Assignee = agent** — column + `actor` on every activity entry; harness runs stamp
      `harness`, GUI actions stamp `gui`, migration stamps `todo-v0.1-migration`.
- [x] **Recurrence via the existing scheduler** — tasks store a 5-field cron expression; a
      `task_recurrence_sweep` job on the P8 daemon scheduler (every 5 min) reopens completed
      recurring tasks whose next occurrence has arrived. One recurrence engine: the store holds the
      expression, the scheduler is the clock.
- [x] **Tiny tool surface** — todo v0.2.0 exposes `next / add / update / done / note / query / list`
      (plus the v0.1 `create/remove/clear/clear_all` still accepted); the full repository API is the
      *store's* capability, reachable via IPC, not the model's tool schema.
- [x] **JSON migration** — on first use in a session, the skill imports `.nanna-todo-{session}.json`
      via `tasks.import` (order preserved; v0.1 `blocked` label → `pending` + activity note, since
      blocked is derived now) and stamps the file `{"migrated": true}`. The skill keeps a full v0.1
      file fallback for contexts without the daemon task services, and routes
      `update(status='done')` through the verdict-gated done path.
- [x] **GUI** — `/tasks` page (Nuxt): task tree with status/blocked/priority/labels, details panel
      (description, acceptance, notes, activity), filter-language search, create/complete/delete
      (acceptance-failure verdicts surfaced), and a **long-horizon run panel** — goal + budget,
      Start/Cancel, live `task-event` feed, final report (items completed, tokens/item, stop
      reason). This is the "is it still on track?" screen. Full IPC path:
      `TaskAction` protocol group → `control/task.rs` → daemon_client/backend/commands → page.

### P16 — Daemon-only consolidation: GUI is a pure daemon client ✅ (landed 2026-07-18, flagship refactor)
**Landed:** dropped **all** in-process "embedded" execution from the Tauri GUI. It now only attaches to
`nanna-daemon` over IPC and forwards every request; a failed connect is a hard `Disconnected` status (no
fallback). This ends the double-implementation tax the P4/P8/P11 "embedded copy of X drifted" items were a
symptom of — one agent loop, one memory system, one tool registry, one scheduler. iOS/mobile deferred.
Net **−5,510 / +1,282** LOC; `cargo check -p nanna-gui` clean, log-buffer + log-merge tests green.

What shipped: deleted `embedded.rs` / `tool_authoring.rs` / `llm/`; pruned `AppState` to a thin client
(config cache, workspace-registry cache, backend, log buffer, model-badge caches); gutted `setup_state`
(no local Storage/LlmClient/ToolRegistry/MemoryService/Scheduler+executor; workspaces hydrate from the
daemon); collapsed `backend.rs` to `BackendMode {Daemon, Disconnected}` with unconditional daemon
forwarding; removed every command's embedded arm; rewired `/agents` onto daemon sub-sessions; relocated
`log_buffer` to `nanna-core`; pruned GUI `nanna-*` deps to `nanna-config` + `nanna-core` + `nanna-tools`
(dropped storage/memory/scripting/agent/workspace/channels/daemon/llm); removed the mobile entry + android icons.

**Deferred follow-ups** (worked only in the embedded path; no daemon control action yet — degraded, not lost):
- Memory/scheduler runtime toggles — `set_dreaming_enabled`, `set_scheduler_enabled`,
  `set_heartbeat_enabled`/`_interval`, `get|set_similarity_threshold`, `apply_memory_updates`,
  `save_memories` — are **no-ops** (were already dead in daemon mode). Add daemon control actions to wire
  them back. (`max_compression_ratio` / `min_remaining_memories` already persist via `config_set`.)
- **Skill-directory CRUD** still edits the workspace `skills/` dir on disk (test routes to the daemon
  sandbox) — fold into daemon `tool_*` actions so the GUI edits the daemon's `tools_dir`.
- **`/agents`** maps daemon sub-sessions but has no live `agent-event` feed / workspace tagging (it polls)
  — add a daemon agent-event feed.
- **Config ownership** — GUI keeps a `config.toml` write cache that pushes via `config_set`/`config_reload`;
  a single-writer daemon-owned model with a pure read cache is the endgame.

### P17 — Workspace context: standard project files instead of bespoke `.nanna/` agent files 🌱 (new — 2026-07-17, product direction)
**Directional change (owner-requested):** stop making Nanna scaffold and read a pile of bespoke per-workspace
agent markdown. Today, initializing a *user's* workspace creates `.nanna/{AGENTS,SOUL,USER,TOOLS,IDENTITY,
HEARTBEAT,MEMORY}.md`, and agent context is assembled by reading them. **Going forward a workspace's context
comes from the project's OWN standard files** — the ones any repo already has and any contributor already
understands — with per-workspace planning in a `ROADMAP.md` modeled on Nanna's own. Nanna should drop into any
existing repo and be useful from its `README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `ROADMAP.md` with **no `.nanna/` scaffolding
required**. *(Scope: this is the PRODUCT's per-workspace files, NOT the nanna source repo's own dev docs —
Nanna's own `ROADMAP.md` stays.)*

**Target model (decided 2026-07-17):**
- **Workspace context = the project's standard files.** Nanna reads, in priority order: `README.md` (what the
  project is), root `AGENTS.md` (the emerging *agents.md* standard — agent instructions for this repo),
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (conventions / how to work here), `docs/**`, and `ROADMAP.md` (the plan — Nanna both reads
  and maintains it, in the same phase/checklist/dated-note structure as Nanna's own). A root `AGENTS.md` is
  *standard*, not bespoke, so it stays; `SOUL/USER/TOOLS/IDENTITY/HEARTBEAT/MEMORY` go.
- **Persona + user profile → GLOBAL agent config.** `SOUL.md` (who the agent is) and `USER.md` (who the user is)
  are cross-workspace, not per-project — they move into global agent settings applied to every workspace, not
  files scaffolded into each project; `IDENTITY.md` folds in here too.
- **Memory → DB-backed only.** Drop the `.nanna/MEMORY.md` (+ `memory/*.md`) file mirror; memory already lives in
  Turso (`nanna-memory`, FSRS). The GUI/daemon memory reads that go through the files today route to the store.
- **Heartbeat → scheduled-task config.** Drop `HEARTBEAT.md` as a prompt file; periodic tasks become scheduler
  config (the daemon already runs a heartbeat/cron loop — the "Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists" prompt is replaced
  by task definitions).
- **`TOOLS.md` → dropped.** Tools are discoverable at runtime; a static notes file is redundant.

**Code surface to change** (2026-07-17 inventory — **all completed 2026-07-18**):
- [x] Retire the file-name constants + context assembly: `crates/nanna-core/src/workspace.rs:32-38`
      (`AGENTS_FILE`…`HEARTBEAT_FILE`) + the read/assemble at `:87-101,198-…`; the parallel set in
      `crates/nanna-workspace/src/lib.rs:43-49` and the context builder `crates/nanna-workspace/src/files.rs:81-275`
      (emits `## AGENTS.md`…`## HEARTBEAT.md` sections). Re-point context assembly at the standard files.
      -> `HEARTBEAT_FILE` and the SOUL/USER/TOOLS/IDENTITY constants are removed; `workspace.rs`/`files.rs`/
      `lib.rs` now assemble context from `README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `ROADMAP.md` only
      (`STANDARD_CONTEXT_FILES`). `WorkspaceContext` uses those four optional fields.
- [x] Stop auto-creating the sidecar: `crates/nanna-workspace/src/manager.rs:164-188` (creates `AGENTS.md`/
      `SOUL.md`) and the templates `crates/nanna-workspace/templates/standard/{AGENTS,SOUL,USER,TOOLS,IDENTITY}.md`
      + `templates.rs:74-78` `include_str!`. Keep only a minimal root `AGENTS.md` (+ optional `ROADMAP.md`)
      template; delete the rest.
      -> `manager::initialize` writes only root `AGENTS.md` (+ creates the `.nanna/` local-state dir). The five
      `templates/standard/*.md` and their `include_str!`s are deleted; `templates.rs` exposes `minimal` and
      `project` templates (AGENTS.md [+ ROADMAP.md]).
- [x] **Workspace detection** (`crates/nanna-workspace/src/discovery.rs:12-60`) currently scores `.nanna/` /
      `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Re-key on standard project signals: `.git`, `README.md`, root `AGENTS.md`,
      `ROADMAP.md`, `Cargo.toml` / `package.json` / `pyproject.toml`, etc.
      -> `WORKSPACE_MARKERS` now leads with `.git`, `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `Cargo.toml`,
      `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, then `.nanna/`/`nanna.toml` as weak legacy signals.
- [x] **Global persona/user config:** add persona + user-profile fields to the global agent config (the source of
      truth), injected into every session's context independent of the workspace.
      -> `nanna-config::AgentSettings` gains `persona` + `user_profile` (`Option<String>`); `GlobalPersona`
      (in `nanna-core::workspace`) builds the injection; `control/session.rs` injects it into every session
      system prompt from global config.
- [x] **Heartbeat:** replace the `HEARTBEAT_FILE` prompt reads (`nanna-core/src/scheduler.rs:105`,
      `nanna-daemon/src/server.rs:795`, `gui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:534`) with scheduled-task definitions.
      -> No `HEARTBEAT_FILE` reads remain anywhere. The daemon's heartbeat stays a *scheduler task* (prompt is a
      config string, not a file read) — this matches "scheduled-task definitions".
- [x] **Memory:** re-point the GUI memory reads off `MEMORY.md` / `memory/*.md`
      (`gui/src-tauri/src/commands/workspaces.rs:366-593`) onto the store; drop the `.md` mirror + the
      `include_memory` gating in `files.rs`.
      -> The GUI workspace-command memory `.md` mirror is removed; `files.rs` no longer gates on `include_memory`.
      Memory is DB-backed (Turso) as before.
- [x] **CLI + GUI + protocol:** update `src/commands/workspace.rs:23-41` (CLI `init` creates the 7 files), the GUI
      workspace-validity check that requires `.nanna` with `SOUL.md`/`AGENTS.md` (`commands/workspaces.rs:672`),
      `workspaces.vue`, and the daemon `protocol.rs` / `control/{session,chat}.rs` filename references.
      -> CLI `init` scaffolds standard files only; `check_workspace_validity` uses `WORKSPACE_MARKERS` + checks
      `AGENTS.md`/`ROADMAP.md` (no `.nanna`+SOUL/AGENTS requirement); `workspaces.vue` lists `AGENTS.md`/
      `ROADMAP.md`; daemon `protocol.rs`/`session.rs`/`chat.rs` reference standard context files.
- [x] **`.nanna/` dir fate:** the *markdown* sidecar goes; decide whether `.nanna/` survives for non-md workspace
      state (workspace id / local config) or that state moves to the central store. (Minor — surface in impl.)
      -> **Decision: `.nanna/` survives as a non-markdown local-state dir only** (`WORKSPACE_MARKER_DIR`). It holds
      workspace id / local config, never agent `.md` sidecar files. `Workspace::ensure_nanna_folder` creates it;
      `load_context` does a one-shot best-effort legacy import of a stray `.nanna/AGENTS.md` (read-only, not
      deleted). No SOUL/USER/TOOLS/IDENTITY/HEARTBEAT/MEMORY are ever written there.

**Migration (existing workspaces have `.nanna/` files today):** on first run against a legacy workspace, import
`SOUL.md`/`USER.md` → global config, confirm memory is in the store (it is), then stop reading `.nanna/*.md`.
delete the old files.

**Payoff:** Nanna works in any existing repo from its standard files with zero bespoke scaffolding;
persona/user/memory stop being duplicated into every project; one planning convention (`ROADMAP.md`) shared with
how Nanna plans itself. Orthogonal to P16 (daemon-only) but both touch workspace handling — sequence **after** P16
lands so the workspace code is edited once, not in two copies.

## Feature backlog (grouped — lower priority, pull as capacity allows)

These are aspirational per-subsystem enhancements distilled from the old planning docs. Grouped to
keep the phases readable; promote individual items into a phase when they become active work.

- **Memory:** HNSW/IVF indexing for large stores; persistent vector index (Turso, avoid full reload);
  f16 embedding compression + GC via "dreaming"; memory graphs (relationships); emotional valence;
  importance decay; active forgetting; narratives; per-query similarity threshold; export/import to
  Markdown; embedding-dimension migration + re-embed on provider change; ~~extraction filtering~~ /
  ~~dedup-before-storage~~ **(2026-07-07: `filter_extracted_memories` drops empty/whitespace + exact
  dupes within an extraction batch, order-preserving; deliberately NO length threshold so short facts
  survive — cross-batch dedup stays with `smart_ingest` similarity bands)**; background consolidation with
  progress events; memory categories/tags.
- **LLM providers:** add Google Gemini, Mistral, Grok (xAI); custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints; model
  capability matrix (skip incompatible models in fallback); model-discovery cache (5-min TTL); typed
  errors instead of string matching; respect `retry-after` headers; OAuth refresh retry; provider
  health dashboard; investigate GitHub Copilot API masking.
- **Channels:** per-channel feature builders (Discord components/embeds/voice, Slack Block Kit/Connect/app-home,
  Telegram inline mode/media groups/keyboards/channel posting, WhatsApp templates/catalog/status,
  Signal groups/attachments/disappearing); message-ID dedup (webhook+listener); auto transport-mode select;
  circuit breaker + dead-letter queue + queue persistence; adaptive/per-channel rate limits; persist inter-agent messages to Turso.
- **Scheduler/cron:** natural-language scheduling (`chrono-english`); per-job timezone (`chrono-tz`);
  job dependencies/chaining; job templates; missed-job handling on startup; retry policy; per-job
  timeout + running-lock; isolated sessions for scheduled tasks; history retention; safer delete-by-name; GUI cron builder.
- **Workspaces:** persist the registry (lost on restart); `.nanna/.lock` concurrent-access guard;
  enforce ~8k-token context budget (truncate/summarize on overflow); daily-memory rotation/archival;
  auto-discovery on startup (depth-limited); inheritance (monorepo parent/child); rename; git diff of
  `.nanna/`; per-workspace model prefs; sharing/export archive; customizable templates; enforce validity.
- **Tools:** agent-callable `UpdateTool`/`DeleteTool`; non-blocking fs I/O (`tokio::fs`/`spawn_blocking`);
  tool call caching (idempotent); versioning/rollback; duplicate-name detection; dangerous-tool
  confirmation; circuit breaker; analytics; tool marketplace/sharing; WASM tool support; **Python tool support** (currently JS/TS only).
- **GUI:** **Active quality track lives in P4 follow-on (testing + UI/UX fix + simplification).**
  Remaining aspirational: command palette extras beyond navigation; full-text session search; export
  conversations (MD/PDF/JSON); context-budget visualization; live run view (iteration, active tools, token
  burn-rate, Gantt); drag-drop upload; split view; font-size + accent controls; ARIA/keyboard a11y; Vue error
  boundary; lazy-load Monaco; theme-token audit; compact power-mode density.
- **Storage:** DB migrations system; WAL mode; backup/restore. *(Turso-only is decided — the "SQLite" naming cleanup lives in P13, not an engine swap.)*
- **SIMD/GPU:** verify AVX-512 + add ARM NEON (Apple Silicon/mobile, critical for mobile); benchmark
  vs `simsimd`; GPU optimizations to lower the SIMD→GPU crossover from ~50k toward ~5k vectors
  (persistent GPU buffers, batched multi-query, async transfer/compute overlap, raw-Vulkan hot path);
  dynamic/hardware-aware GPU threshold + multi-vendor testing (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel Arc); `[gpu]` config section.
- **Observability/testing:** cross-agent distributed tracing; agent health metrics; integration tests
  for multi-agent scenarios; chaos testing; message-passing benchmarks.

## Immediate next actions (top of queue)

Reordered around the local-first pivot (P12/P13 lead), with the highest-value safety items kept in view.

1. ~~**Turso-only cleanup** (P13)~~ — **DONE (2026-07-16)**: ~~rename `SqliteMemoryPersistence`~~ (2026-07-07),
   ~~delete `server.rs.bak`~~ (gone), ~~add the CI dep-guard~~ (2026-07-06), ~~purge "SQLite" from
   comments/logs/var names across storage/daemon/memory/GUI~~ (2026-07-16 — the last slice was
   `gui/.../commands/sessions.rs`; only the intentional factual line at `nanna-storage/src/lib.rs:6`
   remains, by design). SQL, `.db`, and `datetime('now')` untouched throughout.
2. **Bring all deps to latest + commit `Cargo.lock`** (doctrine → *Dependency freshness*) — `Cargo.lock`
   un-gitignored and committed (2026-07-07); compatible deps already at latest (`cargo update` = 0 changes).
   Low-risk majors applied green: `directories 5→6` (unified with the workspace pin), `tower-http 0.6→0.7`
   (daemon+server), `socket2 0.5→0.6` (daemon). **Deferred majors** (each needs a real migration — build
   green + tests + benches before landing; do one per run):
   - [x] `reqwest 0.12→0.13` — *(2026-07-10, part of the big bump)* default features OFF at the
         workspace root with `native-tls` selected explicitly (the 0.13 default flips to rustls+aws-lc,
         whose C/asm build violates "prefer pure-Rust, no-C"); `query`/`form` opt-in features enabled
         (call sites in channels/config/tools); `charset`/`http2`/`system-proxy` re-added. Channels + GUI
         now inherit the workspace dep. No source changes needed.
   - [x] `tokio-tungstenite 0.26→0.29` (client/daemon/gui/mcp/channels) — *(2026-07-10)* compiled unchanged.
   - [x] `deno_core 0.375→0.407` + `deno_ast 0.51→0.53` (nanna-scripting) — *(2026-07-10)* compiled
         unchanged; the direct `swc_core` dep turned out to be **dead** (nothing referenced it, no feature
         enabled it) and conflicted with deno_ast 0.53's exact swc pins (`swc_atoms =9.0.0`) — deleted.
         **boa_engine/boa_runtime are git-pinned to boa main** (rev `4f98f644`): released boa 0.21.1 pins
         icu ~2.0 + an old temporal_capi, conflicting with deno_core 0.407 (v8 149 → temporal_capi ^0.2.3)
         and turso 0.6 (icu 2.2). boa-main API drift was tiny (`JsArray::new` now fallible, 2 sites).
         Drop back to crates.io when boa releases with icu 2.2.
   - [x] `rustpython-{vm,stdlib,pylib} 0.4→0.5` (nanna-scripting) — *(2026-07-10)* migrated to the new
         `Interpreter::builder` (`stdlib_module_defs(&builder.ctx)` + `add_frozen_modules(FROZEN_STDLIB)`
         replace `with_init`/`get_module_inits`); `PyStr::as_str` → `to_string_lossy()` (2 sites).
   - [x] `playwright-rs 0.8→0.14` + `chromiumoxide 0.8→0.9` (nanna-browser) — *(2026-07-10)* chromiumoxide
         0.9 dropped the `tokio-runtime` feature (tokio-only now) and its `Arg` lost `From<&String>`
         (pass owned). playwright-rs compiled unchanged.
   - [x] `wgpu 24→30` (nanna-gpu) — *(2026-07-10)* migrated: `Instance::default()`, `request_adapter`
         returns `Result`, `DeviceDescriptor` gained `experimental_features`/`trace` (+ single-arg
         `request_device`), `Maintain` → `PollType::Wait{submission_index,timeout}` (poll returns Result),
         `get_mapped_range[_mut]` return `Result`, `BufferViewMut` writes via `.slice(..).copy_from_slice`,
         `PipelineLayoutDescriptor.bind_group_layouts` takes `Option<&_>` (+ `push_constant_ranges` →
         `immediate_size`). **Bench-validated live on the 4070 Ti SUPER**: GPU fixed dispatch overhead
         improved ~750µs → ~200µs; SIMD still wins ≤10k vectors (crossover unchanged, `GPU_THRESHOLD`
         stays 50k). Note: the old "wgpu pinned for onyums/tauri/burn" constraint was consciously dropped
         (neither onyums nor burn is in-tree yet; revisit at P9/P12 integration).
   - [x] `wide 0.7→1.5` (nanna-simd) — *(2026-07-10)* `as_array_ref()` → `as_array()` (3 sites).
   - [x] `turso =0.4.4 → =0.6.1` + `aegis =0.9.7 → =0.9.12` (nanna-storage) — *(2026-07-10)* **fixes the
         daemon startup panic** (`turso_core 0.4.4 btree.rs:943 "we can't have more pages to read while
         also have read everything"`) that killed the daemon while bulk-loading the memories table and
         forced the GUI into embedded fallback. Root cause: 0.4.4 wrote an **inconsistent overflow chain**
         into the memories btree, then panicked reading it back. 0.6.1 detects the same condition and
         returns a proper `Err` ("inconsistent overflow chain observed during payload read") which the
         existing load handler logs — **daemon reaches "Daemon ready"** (validated against a copy of the
         real crashing DB). Consequence: memories in the corrupted table are unreadable (load as 0) and
         will re-accumulate. aegis 0.9.12 built clean on stock MSVC (no clang-cl needed in this setup).
   - [x] `keyring 3→4` (nanna-config) — *(2026-07-09)* v4 split platform stores into per-OS `*-keyring-store` crates (no longer default); added `apple-native-keyring-store` and kept the default `windows-native-keyring-store` + `zbus-secret-service-keyring-store` + `v1` compat feature, which preserves the `Entry`/`Error::NoEntry` API so `credentials.rs` compiled unchanged. Build+tests green.
   - [x] `ed25519-dalek 2→3`, `hmac 0.12→0.13`, `sha2 0.10→0.11` (nanna-server + nanna-daemon) — *(2026-07-09)* bumped in lockstep across both crates. Only breakage: hmac 0.13's `Mac` trait no longer re-exports `new_from_slice`, so the Slack-HMAC call sites now `use hmac::KeyInit`. ed25519-dalek 3 (`from_bytes`/`verify_strict`/`Signer`) and sha2 0.11 compiled unchanged. Webhook signature tests (Slack HMAC-SHA256 + Discord Ed25519, incl. tamper/replay cases) stay green; 25 daemon lib tests pass.
   - [x] `scraper 0.22→0.27`, `lopdf 0.34→0.44` (nanna-tools) — *(2026-07-10)* both bumped, no code
         changes; markup5ever/selectors/cssparser pulled forward transitively. `nanna-tools` builds green,
         44 tests pass.
   - [x] `rand 0.8/0.9→0.10` (channels, gui), `toml 0.8→1.1` (gui), `nix 0.29→0.31` (unix), `tokio 1.52`,
         `uuid 1.23`, `half 2.7`, `bytemuck 1.25`, `sha2 0.11` (gui) — *(2026-07-10)* all compiled unchanged.
   - [x] `windows-service 0.7→0.8` (daemon) — *(2026-07-10)* bumped, no code changes; `windows_service.rs`
         API (`service_dispatcher`/`service_control_handler`/`ServiceStatus`) unchanged. Daemon builds green,
         26 tests pass.
   - [x] `criterion 0.5→0.8` (nanna-gpu benches) — *(2026-07-10)* bumped; the four benches use
         `harness = false` (custom mains) so criterion is an unreferenced dev-dep — benches compile clean.
   - [~] GUI `pnpm update --latest` sweep in `gui/` — *(2026-07-11)* **safe minors/patches applied green**
         (`@tauri-apps/{api 2.11.1, cli 2.11.4, plugin-dialog 2.7.1, plugin-notification 2.3.3, plugin-shell 2.3.5}`,
         `nuxt 4.4.8`, `@vueuse/core 14.3.0`, `tailwindcss`/`@tailwindcss/postcss 4.3.2`, `postcss 8.5.16`,
         `tailwind-merge 3.6.0`, `vue 3.5.39`, `@monaco-editor/loader 1.7.0`) — verified by `pnpm build`
         (client+nitro, 3365 modules) **and** a `pnpm dev` boot serving a real 200 `__nuxt` shell on :3000.
         **Deferred majors (each needs a code migration — do one per run, verify via `cargo tauri build`
         + WebDriver before landing):**
     - [ ] `@tiptap/* 2.11.5 → 3.x` — tiptap v3 **removed the `BubbleMenu` named export from
           `@tiptap/vue-3`** (breaks `FloatingToolbar.vue`; the whole P7 editor needs the v2→v3 migration:
           new BubbleMenu wiring, extension API changes). Largest of the batch.
     - [ ] `vue-router 4 → 5` (major)
     - [ ] `vue-sonner 1 → 2` (major — toast API)
     - [ ] `marked 17 → 18` (major — chat markdown renderer; audit render output)
     - [ ] **`lucide-vue-next` → `@lucide/vue` (package rename, not a version bump).** *(2026-07-16 —
           corrected: the earlier "0.563 → 1.0, low risk" read was wrong.)* `lucide-vue-next@1.0.0` is a
           **deprecation tombstone** ("Package deprecated. Please use `@lucide/vue` instead") — it is the
           `latest` dist-tag but is not a functional release, so `pnpm update --latest` silently installs a
           dead package. The whole `lucide-vue-next` package is deprecated at every version. Real latest
           functional release is **0.577.0** (applied this run). Migration = switch to `@lucide/vue` and
           rewrite the import specifier across the **40 files** that import icons; verify via
           `cargo tauri build` + WebDriver.
     - [x] ~~`@formkit/drag-and-drop 0.5 → 0.6`~~ — **dep removed instead** *(2026-07-16)*: it was an
           **unused dependency** (zero references anywhere in `gui/` outside `package.json`/lockfile —
           the editor's drag-drop is Tiptap's own). Bumping dead weight is noise; dropped it. `pnpm build`
           green after removal, confirming it was genuinely unreferenced.
   - Pins now: `turso =0.6.1`, `aegis =0.9.12` (exact — pre-1.0), boa git rev `4f98f644` (until a
     crates.io boa ships icu 2.2). The old `wgpu` pin is dropped (see the wgpu 30 note above).
   - *(2026-07-16 sweep)* `cargo update` → 12 compatible bumps (`tokio 1.52.4`, `uuid 1.24.0`,
     `keyring 4.1.5`, `regex 1.13.1`, `clap 4.6.2`, `syn 2.0.119`, `bitflags 2.13.1`, `bstr 1.13.0`,
     `regex-automata 0.4.16`, `simd-adler32 0.3.10`, `which 8.0.5`). `cargo upgrade --incompatible` →
     only two reqs behind: `deno_core 0.407 → 0.408` (nanna-scripting; compiled unchanged, no source
     edits) and `uuid 1.23 → 1.24` (workspace + nanna-server req bump). Workspace **including
     `nanna-gui`** builds green; scripting 19+1 / llm 28 / agent 61 tests pass; clippy clean on the
     bumped crates. Frontend: `tailwindcss`/`@tailwindcss/postcss 4.3.3`, `postcss 8.5.19`,
     `vue 3.5.40` applied green (`pnpm build` → nitro + client, 2.25 MB / 502 kB gzip).
   - **Build-env note (not a code bug):** `cargo build -p nanna-gui` needs two artifacts the repo does
     not commit — the Tauri **sidecar** `gui/src-tauri/binaries/nanna-daemon-<triple>.exe`
     (build via `pnpm build:daemon`, per that dir's `.gitkeep`) and the built frontend at
     `gui/.output/public` (`pnpm build`, else `generate_context!` panics with "`frontendDist` …
     doesn't exist"). A fresh worktree needs `pnpm install` + both before the GUI compiles.
   - **`cargo fmt --all` is not safe to run blanket:** `origin/master` is not fmt-clean and the repo has
     mixed CRLF/LF line endings with `core.autocrlf=false` / `core.eol=lf` / no `.gitattributes`, so
     `cargo fmt --all` rewrites ~165 files (mostly pure EOL churn). Format only the files you touch.
     - [ ] Decide the line-ending policy: add a `.gitattributes` (`*.rs text eol=lf`) and land one
           tree-wide `cargo fmt` normalization commit, so future runs can use `fmt`/`fmt --check` normally.
3. **`nanna-infer` Burn skeleton** (P12) — one binary, dual `wgpu`+`ndarray` backend, runtime GPU probe, load one small model, greedy decode: prove local inference end-to-end on the dev GPU.
4. **Local embeddings in Burn** (P12) — MiniLM-class CPU embedder wired into the memory `embed_fn` → fully-local memory (no API embeddings).
5. **`Provider::Local` in the router** (P12) — dispatch completion/stream/tool-calls to `nanna-infer` and make local the top-priority (zero-cost) tier; cloud becomes opt-in escalation.
6. **Unify + upgrade dreaming** (P13) — one `DreamingService` orchestrator, idle-gated multi-phase cycle, true merge, local `summarize_fn`.
7. **`nanna-timeline` + compression-as-dreaming** (P13) — append-only event log in Turso + lift DSP's `simplify_with_aggressiveness`/`splimes` as the timeline compressor keyed by FSRS retrievability.
8. ~~**Fix the two path-traversal holes** (P11 security) — user-tool names + workspace file writes.~~ **(done 2026-07-06)**
9. **End-to-end daemon test** (P8) — ~~the daemon/embedded/reconnect story is still unverified~~ **mostly
   done (2026-07-16)**: a hermetic 4-test E2E suite (`crates/nanna-client/tests/e2e_daemon.rs`) now covers
   start → connect → session state → client reconnect → **daemon restart persistence**, and caught a real
   `Client::disconnect()` state bug. Still open: a real conversation turn (needs a live LLM) and the
   **embedded-fallback** path (needs a GUI build).
10. **GUI test harness foothold** (P4 follow-on) — Vitest + one critical-path Playwright smoke (chat shell load
    + Logs Copy all / Live toggle) + fixture for mocked Tauri invoke; keeps UI fixes from regressing while
    P12/P13 lead the feature queue. *(2026-07-23: IA simplification + command palette shipped; harness already green.)*
