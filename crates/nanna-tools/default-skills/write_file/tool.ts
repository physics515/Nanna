SAFETY: a shrinking rewrite of a file that changed since you last read it returns the file's CURRENT content to merge (not a refusal); a shrinking rewrite that deletes more top-level sections than it keeps is held ONCE with the current content and the removed names — send the same content again to confirm the deletions; blocked if new content is under 30% of the last known-good size (likely truncation), if a .py file would not parse, or if the filename looks like a versioned copy. After each write the cheapest structural check (sh -n / node --check / JSON.parse) runs and its verdict is appended; a full overwrite parks the previous version at <file>.__prev__ for recovery and the richest earlier version at <file>.__best__.",

    // draft. Observed 2026-08-10 (ornith leg): a 9768-byte draft that scored
    // 2/42 latched the high-water, and the 30% floor it set (2930 B) refused

    // (3335 B = 34%) one small edit away from being refused — while the
    // 2952-byte write that actually cost two tests cleared it by 22 bytes.
    // When no structural check has ever passed (no checker applies), the
    // floor falls back to the old hi anchor, so nothing loses protection.
