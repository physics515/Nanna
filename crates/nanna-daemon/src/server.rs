/// will NOT sweep up an inherited backlog. Its own doc says that remainder is
/// "still `drain_backfill`'s job at `drain_backfill`'s priority".
///
/// The catch is that nothing was calling `drain_backfill` at that priority
/// during a session. Its only triggers are BINDING events -- daemon start,
/// provider switch, width reprobe -- and an ordinary session has none of them.
/// So a row parked by a *transient* embedding failure, or a backlog inherited
/// from a previous run, waited for a restart. That is the gap this closes, and
/// it is why the two coexist rather than one replacing the other: one drains
/// the work the turn created, the other drains everything else, at the first
/// moment no turn is live.
///
/// Drain rows that were parked mid-session, at the first moment no turn is live.
///
/// [`nanna_memory::MemoryService::store_unembedded`] is durable and honest —
/// the write lands, the row is reachable by its `source_id` handle, and it is
/// queued for backfill — but until now the ONLY things that started a drain
/// were **binding** events: daemon start, a provider switch, a width reprobe.
/// An ordinary session has none of those. So a row parked by a *transient*
/// embedding failure stayed unsearchable for the rest of the session, and the
/// store's own doc comment says exactly that: it "is recovered, not lost — but
/// the latency is a session, not a moment, and closing that needs a drain
/// trigger the memory crate does not own". This is that trigger, and it lives
/// here because the daemon is what owns both the run registry and the drain.
///
/// **Bound: one probe per active→idle cycle** — not per write, and not on a
/// timer. [`ChatRunRegistry::wait_active`] followed by
/// [`ChatRunRegistry::wait_idle`] is precisely one turn's lifetime, so the
/// probe rate is bounded above by the *turn* rate, which is bounded by a human
/// typing. A timer would have had to pick an interval that is either too slow
/// to matter or a poll; an edge does not.
///
/// The probe is what [`drain_backfill`] already costs on a store that is
/// complete for the bound model, and it is worth stating exactly rather than
/// as "a query": `entries_missing_model(model, 1)` is an **in-memory** scan of
/// the entries cache under a read lock — it short-circuits at the first entry
/// with no bucket for `model`, so it walks the whole cache only in the case
/// where there is nothing to do — followed by two `LIMIT 1` local Turso
/// queries (`parents_without_chunks`, `chunks_needing_embedding`). No provider
/// request is made unless work is actually found. At a 100k-entry store that
/// is single-digit milliseconds, once per turn.
///
/// **Worst case is one turn of latency, not one session.** `wait_active`
/// registers interest and then reads the flag, so a turn that begins AND ends
/// inside that window leaves no edge to observe and its rows wait for the next
/// turn. That is a bounded miss and a deliberate non-fix: the rows are durable
/// and handle-addressable the whole time, and the alternative — probing before
/// parking — turns the loop into a spin on an idle daemon, which is the exact
/// property this shape was chosen to avoid.
///
/// **It adds a trigger, never a second rate.** The drain it may start is the
/// existing [`drain_backfill`], so it inherits the process-wide `drain_serial`
/// mutex (one drain at a time), the `wait_idle` priority gate (a turn arriving
/// mid-drain takes the slot back within one in-flight embed) and the
