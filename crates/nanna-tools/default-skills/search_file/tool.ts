    // nanna-scripting/tests/search_file_skill.rs, taken through the real Boa
    // bridge on a debug build — the build the daemon actually runs.
    //
    // TIME is the primary bound, because time is the actual constraint: the
    // script deadline is 30s (ScriptedTool's default timeout_ms; this tool
    // declares no `timeout` override) and a script that overruns it returns
    // NOTHING — the failure is total, not degraded.
    //
    // The measurement that shapes everything below: `content.split("\n")` is
    // ~99% of the cost of a file-scanning skill, and its cost is the PRODUCT
    // of line count and string length, ~1e-8 x lines x chars seconds:
    //
    //   128 KiB /    653 lines   0.91s      128 KiB /  2,428 lines   3.41s

    // Isolating the stages showed the split ITSELF is the whole cost — the
    // per-line loop over the result is free (32,768 lines: split alone 21.3s,
    // split+regex 23.2s, and an empty JS loop of the same count 70ms). So
    // neither a byte cap nor a line cap alone can bound it; the product must
    // be broken. Splitting in bounded slices does exactly that, turning

    //   1 MiB / 19,419 lines:  one split 184.06s  ->  4 KiB slices 3.05s (60x)
