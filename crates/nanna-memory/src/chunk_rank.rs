//! Collapsing per-chunk search hits back to the memories that own them.
//!
//! Chunk search returns pieces; recall returns memories. Something has to
//! decide what a memory's score is when several of its chunks matched, and the
//! choice is load-bearing in a way that is easy to get wrong.
//!
//! **Averaging is wrong.** A memory whose chunk 7 of 40 answers the query
//! exactly scores 0.9 on that chunk and ~0.1 on the other 39; the mean buries
//! it under a memory that is vaguely on-topic throughout. That is the exact
//! failure chunking exists to fix — a long memory embedded whole becomes a
//! centroid of everything it contains — so averaging the chunks reintroduces it
//! one level up.
//!
//! **Summing is worse.** It makes score scale with length, so the longest
//! memory wins every query regardless of relevance.
//!
//! So: **max**. A memory is as relevant as its most relevant piece. But a
//! memory that matched in six places is genuinely better evidence than one that
//! matched in a single place at the same peak, and max alone cannot express
//! that. Hence the two-part rule below.
