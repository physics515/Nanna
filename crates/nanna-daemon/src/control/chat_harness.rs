//! Long-horizon chat (P19): every chat turn is a harness run.
//!
//! Before this, chat and the long-horizon harness were two execution paths.
//! Chat called [`crate::agent_service::AgentService::chat_with_options`] — one
//! growing context, no continuation machinery, and a follow-up message
//! serialized behind a `tokio::Mutex` until the turn finished. The harness had
//! the continuation machinery (re-anchored O(1) steps, acceptance verdicts,
//! progress-or-replan) but nothing to execute, because nothing turned a
//! request into a plan.
//!
//! [`nanna_agent::planner`] closes that gap, so this module makes the harness
//! THE chat path — there is no other:
//!
//! 1. **Plan.** The turn's message becomes a plan. Conversation and questions
//!    yield one task with no acceptance check, which the harness runs as
//!    exactly one step — the same cost as the old path.
//! 2. **Run — fire and forget.** The Send is ACKed immediately and the run is
//!    driven by a spawned task; a run can last hours, and holding the IPC
//!    request open that long was observed to outlive the GUI client's grace
//!    period ("Received response for unknown request"). Every step streams
//!    into the transcript through the existing `MessageDelta` / `ToolStart` /
//!    `ToolEnd` events.
//! 3. **Recoverable.** The run registers with
//!    [`crate::agent_service::AgentService::register_external_run`], so
//!    navigation away and back rebuilds the live view (`get_run_state`), the
//!    Stop button works (`cancel` wakes the shared token, aborting the
//!    in-flight LLM stream and tool calls, and skipping planning/seeding),
//!    and the full run timeline is persisted with the final message instead
//!    of evaporating with the stream.
//! 4. **Interject.** A message sent while a run is live does not queue behind
//!    it: it is admitted at the next step boundary and jumps the plan, so the
//!    user is answered at the first available opportunity rather than in
//!    however many hours the run takes.
//!
//! **It must feel like chat.** The harness is machinery, not UI: a
//! single-task turn renders as a plain reply — no step banner, no run-stats
//! line — and the `TASK COMPLETE` claim marker the harness verdicts on is
//! stripped before anything is persisted. Run mechanics surface only when
//! there is a genuine multi-item run to attribute work to.

///
/// - The **acceptance pre-check**
///   (`LongHorizonConfig::precheck_acceptance_items`) is the decisive one, and

///   every round. Those completions are therefore NOT progress — they are
///   proof the goal was already met. It is scoped to the round's seeded ids
///   precisely so it can never swallow an interjected user message.
/// - The **structural** one: a round that made no side-effectful tool call (no
///   write, no edit, no shell — the same work-evidence set the
///   completion-claim rung uses) and closed nothing left the world and the
///   plan exactly as it found them.
///
/// The structural signal has a documented limit: `exec` is dual-use, so a
/// read-only `gh pr list` through the shell counts as side-effectful and the
/// round reads as progress. That is the case the pre-check above covers, and
/// it is why the pre-check is the decisive rung rather than a second opinion.
