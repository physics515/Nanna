//! The `screenshot.capture` service.
//!
//! The bundled `screenshot` skill declares it and nothing registered it, so the
//! skill was withheld at every boot. The roadmap's note ("skill exists, service
//! missing, Rust tool is a stub") is accurate: `ScreenshotTool` in
//! `nanna-tools` is a placeholder that returns "not yet implemented", so there
//! was nothing to wire — this is the implementation, not a registration.
//!
//! **Shelling out to the desktop's own capture tool, rather than taking a
//! screen-capture dependency.** Screen capture is not portable library work:
//! on Wayland it goes through the compositor (`grim`), on X11 through the
//! server (`maim`/`scrot`/`import`), and on macOS through `screencapture`.
//! Every one of those already ships on the systems that have it, and each
//! speaks PNG to a file path, so the whole difference between them is a command
//! line.
//!
//! **Registered only when a capture tool and a display session both exist.** A
//! headless daemon has nothing to photograph, and a tool with no session fails
//! at call time with a confusing error — so both are checked at boot and the
//! skill stays withheld otherwise, with the boot line naming what is missing.
