//! Every card and every thread post becomes a workspace memory (P25 Stage 1).
//!
//! P25 decision 14: "Every task is a memory. Every thread post is a memory."
//! The thread stays the permanent record and is never compacted; what dreaming
//! consolidates is these *copies*, each carrying a pointer back to the card and
//! the post it came from (`source_task_id`, `source_note_id`), so a recalled
//! memory can always be followed back to the words it was made from.
//!
//! **Fed by the store's own event sink, not by a bus subscriber.** A
//! `broadcast` receiver that falls behind is told it lagged and the skipped
//! events are gone — for a notification that is a missed toast, here it is a
//! memory that silently never exists. So the sink that already sees every task
//! write ([`crate::task_event_bridge::TaskEventBridge`]) also hands the few
//! kinds that matter to a bounded `mpsc` queue, which one worker drains in
//! order. A full queue is reported, never waited on: the sink is called from
//! the task store's write path, and that path must not block.
//!
//! **The same events feed the episodic timeline** (`memory_events`, via
//! `nanna_timeline`): every thread post as a `message` episode and every status
//! change or verdict as an `outcome`, each carrying the card (and post) ids as
//! its lineage. A card's thread is an event series — this is the raw series
//! the DSP compression step will fold (P25 "DSP timeline compression", step 1).
//! The timeline needs only storage, so it is fed even when memory is disabled.
//!
//! **Board cards only.** A `session`-scoped task is chat scaffolding — the
//! harness writes dozens per turn — and P25 decision 9 deletes that scope.
//! Copying those would flood memory with plan steps; they are skipped until
//! the session → workspace promotion makes every card a board card.
