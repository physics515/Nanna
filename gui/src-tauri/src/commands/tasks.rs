//! Task-store commands for the GUI task management UI.
//!
//! The task store is the chat engine (P19): the planner seeds it, the harness
//! drains it, and the agent's `todo` skill writes to it. The GUI provides
//! a task checklist sidebar on the chat page, plus full CRUD operations
//! for manual task management.
