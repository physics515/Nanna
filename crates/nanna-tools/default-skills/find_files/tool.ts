Two pattern shapes: a pattern with NO slash matches the file's NAME at any depth (`*.rs` finds every Rust file in the tree; `Cargo.toml` finds every manifest), while a pattern WITH a slash is matched against the path relative to the search root (`src/**/*.rs`, `crates/*/Cargo.toml`). `*` matches within one path segment, `**` crosses segments, `?` matches one character.
