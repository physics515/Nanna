//! Task lifecycle events (P25 Stage 1).
//!
//! These are **store mutations**, not run progress. The `TaskRun*` family on
//! the daemon's event bus describes a harness run; these describe what
//! happened to a card, and the board's router is the consumer they exist for.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `nanna-storage`
//!
//! [`TaskRepository`](crate::TaskRepository) is the only place that sees every
//! writer. Above it there are five independent ingress families — the `tasks.*`
//! tool services, the control plane's IPC handlers, the harness's `TaskSource`,
//! the seeding and recurrence sweeps, and the GUI — and two of them have no
//! event bus at all. Worse, some mutations have no caller to instrument:
//! `cascade_cancel` closes a whole subtree and ancestor auto-completion closes
//! parents, both touching rows nobody named. Emitting from the layer above the
//! repository would therefore be emitting from *one* of five doors while
//! claiming to describe the store.
//!
//! `nanna-storage` does not know the daemon's wire protocol, so it emits its
//! own shape through [`TaskEventSink`] and the daemon adapts it to
//! `protocol::Event`.
