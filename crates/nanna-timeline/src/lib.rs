//! The episodic timeline: what happened, on a wall-clock axis.
//!
//! Nanna's memory has two layers and they answer different questions.
//! [`nanna_storage::Memory`] is the **semantic** layer — facts, FSRS-weighted,
//! never expiring, with no single timestamp because a fact is the residue of
//! many episodes. This crate is the **episodic** layer underneath it: the raw
//! stream of messages, tool calls, recalls and outcomes, each stamped with the
//! moment it happened. Dreaming consolidates episodes *into* facts; it never
//! rewrites them.
//!
//! Three properties hold by construction, and each one exists because losing
//! it would make a later phase impossible:
//!
//! 1. **Append-only.** There is no update or delete for a single event. A log
//!    that can be edited cannot answer "what did I know, and when".
//! 2. **Bounded.** Every append caps its content and its lineage; every query
//!    caps its page. The timeline grows without bound in *rows* — that is its
//!    job — so no single operation may grow without bound in *bytes*.
//! 3. **Truncation is visible.** A capped episode records its pre-truncation
//!    length, so a consumer can tell a short event from a shortened one
//!    instead of silently treating the remnant as the whole.
