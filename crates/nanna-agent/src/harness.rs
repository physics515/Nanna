//! Long-horizon harness (P14): drive hours of agent work from the task store
//! with an O(1) re-anchored prompt per step.
//!
//! The design bet: *the agent should never need to remember; the harness makes
//! forgetting survivable.* Every step rebuilds a small prompt from the pinned
//! goal + the one actionable task + the last result — never a growing
//! transcript. Acceptance checks are machine-run by the harness (`done` is a
//! verdict, not an assertion), progress is measured by checks flipping, and a
//! stalled item is re-planned instead of ground on.
//!
//! The engine is pure orchestration over two traits — [`TaskSource`] (the P15
//! store) and [`StepRunner`] (a fresh-context agent per step) — so the whole
//! control loop is deterministically testable without a model.

           discovering the others. Everything you need — running commands, reading, \
           writing and editing files, searching your memory — exists and is waiting behind \

           redirection instead of the file tool, or piping a heredoc instead of editing, \
           skips the checks that keep this run alive and is how work gets silently lost.\n\
         - Use the tools you have; do not narrate actions you did not take. Describe what \
           actually happened, including failures — a wrong result reported honestly is worth \
           more than a confident guess.\n\
         - ONE artifact per job: change the real file in place. Do not build a parallel copy \
           (`thing_v2`, `thing.new`, `thing.backup`) — whatever reads the real file keeps \
           reading the original, so work in a copy never reaches the person who asked for \
           it. This applies to shell redirects too, not just the file tools.
