    // nanna-scripting/tests/code_search_skill.rs, taken through the real Boa
    // bridge on a debug build — the build the daemon actually runs.
    //
    // TIME is the primary bound, because time is the actual constraint: the
    // script deadline is 30s (ScriptedTool's default timeout_ms; this tool
    // declares no `timeout` override) and a script that overruns it returns
    // NOTHING — the failure is total, not degraded. Bounding wall-clock
    // directly, instead of proxying it through a byte count, is also the only
    // bound that holds across machines and file shapes: measured cost per
    // file varies by ~75x with shape alone (11.6 MB read in 1.5s; the same
    // 11.6 MB split into lines, 112s).
    //
    // The reserve is the OVERSHOOT, not a round fraction — the cost of the
    // longest stretch that runs AFTER a budget check and cannot itself be
    // interrupted. With the per-file walk sliced (SPLIT_SLICE_CHARS below)
    // that stretch is no longer the render: it is one directory listing
    // bounded by MAX_ENTRIES (12,000 entries at the measured 8,800/s ≈ 1.4s),
    // then, for the first file under it, a read bounded by MAX_FILE_BYTES
    // (~0.13s at the measured 7.7 MB/s) plus a whole-string prefilter over
    // the same bytes (~0.11s) plus the one slice in flight when the clock
    // trips (~0.08s, derived below) ≈ 1.7s. Triple that so a machine three
    // times slower than the one measured still lands inside the deadline
    // (30000 - 3 x 1700 = 24,900); 20,000 keeps the slack the earlier,
    // un-sliced reserve was sized for and costs nothing to hold.

    // thousands under node_modules/.git/target) is what blew the deadline
    // before a single line of script ran. Measured at 8,800 entries/s;
    // discovery only feeds the scan, so it gets a tenth of the work budget:
    // 1.5s x 8,800 = 13,200, rounded down.
    var MAX_ENTRIES = 12000;

    // READ — pulling a file's text across the bridge measured 7.7 MB/s. No
    // single read may cost more than ~1% of the work budget (0.15s), so the
    // largest file worth reading whole is ~1.15 MB, rounded down to 1 MiB.
    var MAX_FILE_BYTES = 1024 * 1024;

    // SLICE — the width of one split. Splitting a file into lines is the
    // expensive step, and the measurement that pins it down is that
    // `content.split("\n")` costs the PRODUCT of line count and string
    // length, ~1e-8 x lines x chars seconds. At a FIXED 128 KiB:
    //
    //     653 lines  0.91s     2,428 lines  3.41s     7,711 lines 10.29s
    //  26,215 lines 32.86s    65,536 lines 83.96s
    //
    // So a byte cap cannot bound this: 128 KiB of one-char lines (minified
    // JS, a CSV, a log, a wrapped base64 blob) passes any byte cap and then
    // spends ~84s inside ONE uninterruptible split — past the 30s deadline,
    // which means the whole call returns nothing. Isolating the stages showed
    // the split ITSELF is the entire cost, so no cheaper per-line loop helps
    // (32,768 one-char lines: split alone 21.3s, split+regex 23.2s, an empty
    // JS loop of the same count 70ms).
    //
    // Splitting in bounded slices breaks the product, turning
    // O(lines x length) into O(lines x slice):
    //
    //   1 MiB / 19,419 lines:  one split 184.06s  ->  4 KiB slices 3.05s (60x)
    //   128 KiB / 65,536 lines: one split 82.53s  ->  4 KiB slices 2.68s (31x)
    //   128 KiB /  2,428 lines: one split  2.26s  ->  4 KiB slices 0.13s (17x)
    //
    // 4 KiB is also what makes the walk preemptible at all: a slice holds at
    // most SPLIT_SLICE_CHARS/2 lines (every line "x\n"), so one slice costs at
    // most ~1e-8 x 2,048 x 4,096 ≈ 0.08s, and the work budget can be checked
    // between slices instead of only between files.
    var SPLIT_SLICE_CHARS = 4096;

    // RENDER — the file size worth doing line work on at all. Once the walk
    // is sliced its cost is ~1e-8 x lines x SPLIT_SLICE_CHARS, and BYTES NOW
    // BOUND LINES: the densest a file can be packed is one line per two chars
    // ("x\n"), so 128 KiB holds at most 65,536 lines and its walk costs at
    // most ~1e-8 x 65,536 x 4,096 ≈ 2.7s — an eighth of the work budget, the
    // most one file may take. That is the same 128 KiB and the same "eighth
    // of the budget" this cap already carried, but it is only TRUE with the
    // slicing above: measured against one split, that same worst-case file
