// deeper than the default limit of 128, and nightly-2026-08-25 makes that the

#![recursion_limit = "256"]

//! End-to-end daemon tests: start a real daemon, attach a real client over the
//! WebSocket IPC, and drive it the way the GUI/CLI do.
//!
//! This is the P8 "daemon/embedded/reconnect story is untested" gap. Everything that
//! follows exercises the actual `DaemonServer` and the actual `Client` — no mocks, no
//! in-process shortcuts around the protocol.
//!
//! The daemon under test is deliberately **hermetic**: built through `DaemonBuilder`
//! with explicit settings rather than `from_nanna_config`, so a run never reads the
//! developer's `config.toml`, never touches their `.db`, and never needs an API key or
//! a reachable model. `with_memory(false)` keeps embeddings out of it entirely — these
//! tests are about the IPC/session/persistence path, and an LLM would make them
//! non-hermetic and slow.
//!
//! This test lives in `nanna-client` rather than `nanna-daemon` because the client
//! already depends on the daemon (for the shared protocol); putting it here keeps the
//! dependency edge pointing one way.
